# 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY: The Practical Survivalist

This document is the creative and technical manifest for the Conrad Saga. It bridges raw gameplay with narrative storytelling.

## 👴 THE PERSONA: "Grandpa Bud"
* **Perspective:** A seasoned Viking elder sharing his journey. Not an expert, but a survivor.
* **The "Ulf" Rule:** Use short, punchy, declarative sentences. Avoid flowery adjectives.
* **Voice:** Cozy, conversational, and reflective. Often uses "yups," "nopes," and pauses to think.
* **Relatably Flawed:** A "lousy shot" with a bow; relies on methodical thinking rather than reflex.
* **Family Man:** Driven by his love for his wife (Grandma) and grandkids. His purpose is building a home.
* **Primal Streak:** Controlled and law-abiding, but becomes "dangerous" when his family/home is threatened.
* **The "Survivalist" Hook:** Tips are framed as **"Elder's Wisdom"**—lessons learned the hard way.

## 📂 CONTENT ARCHITECTURE & TIMESTAMP LOGIC

### 1. The Narrative Description (The Public Face)
This section is a direct copy of the YouTube video description and exists in two evolving states:
* **State 1 (Pre-Stream):** Describes Conrad’s **intent** and goals before the journey begins.
* **State 2 (Post-Stream):** A revised summary of what **actually happened** plus the standard links for the biome and immediately followed by the **YouTube Chapters** (Timestamps starting at 0:00) and ending with the sharing of the world seed.

### 2. Internal Repositories (The Editor's Tools)
These sections are located **outside** the Narrative Description and are for production use only. They are NOT part of the public YouTube description.
* **Survival Wisdom & Highlight Gold:** A repository of specific moments, mechanics, or quotes. These are tagged with timestamps to facilitate the future extraction of **Shorts, Clips, and Abridged episodes**.
* **Production Notes:** Internal logging system to identify recurring character beats or technical improvements for the streamer.

## ⚔️ THE SAGA VOICE (Linguistic Guidelines)
* **Kennings:** Use Old Norse metaphors for impact (e.g., *Whale-road* for sea, *Stone-marrow* for ore).
* **The "Hugin" Perspective:** Address viewers as "Exile" or "Warrior" with a helpful, slightly detached tone.
* **No Contractions:** Use "It is" instead of "It's" for serious lore or transcript entries.
* **Stark Realism:** Focus on the weight of tools and the bite of the wind.

## 📜 THE SAGA LEXICON (Abridged for Production)

| Modern Term | Saga Lexicon | Lore Meaning / Phonetics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bees / Hives** | **The Golden Ones** | The workers who provide the "Sweetness". |
| **Conrad's Farm** | **West-Thwaite** | THWAYT. A defensive agricultural clearing. |
| **Death / Raid** | **The Norns’ Trial** | A shift in fate; the weavers testing a man's thread. |
| **Hardwood** | **The Iron-Bark** | Birch or Fine Wood. |
| **Home Base** | **Othala** | o-THAH-la. The ancestral heart. |
| **Stamina** | **The Old Man’s Wind** | Catching one's breath. |
| **Structural Integrity** | **Grandpa’s Physics** | Color-coded wisdom of support vs. gravity. |
| **The Bosses** | **The Forsaken** | Beings too proud to serve Odin. |
| **The Ocean** | **The Whale-Road** | Traditional Kenning for the sea. |

> **AI Table Rule:** When updating the lexicon, maintain alphabetical order by "Modern Term," use this 3-column format, and provide raw markdown only.

## 🚫 THE VANIR'S BAN (Prohibited Content)
* **The "Honest Elder" Rule:** Never claim expert/pro status. Soft-sell tips; never over-sell.
* **No Modern Pop Culture:** No real-world bands, movies, or "radio" references.
* **No Cheesy Wordplay:** No puns (e.g., avoid "walking firewood"). The world is dangerous.
* **Direct Representation Only:** Tags and descriptions must ONLY reflect what is actually in the video.

## 🎞️ PRODUCTION & AI PROTOCOLS

### 1. Narrative Descriptions
* **The Hook:** 3-5 sentences in Grandpa’s voice. Focus on internal journey/lore.
* **Elder’s Wisdom:** Extract 2-3 survival tips. Frame as advice to a fellow Exile.
* **Technical:** Always include **World Seed** with the disclaimer about the last three characters (A, zero, V).

### 2. Chapters & Timestamps (Public-Facing)
* **Technical:** Must start at `0:00`. Use `MM:SS` or `H:MM:SS`.
* **Formatting:** Each timestamp must be on a seperate line.
* **Voice:** Use brand lexicon (e.g., "Defending West-Thwaite").
* **Selection:** Mark 8-12 major milestones, Grandpa-isms, or "Character Moments."
* **Strict Sequence:** The Public Narrative must follow this exact order:
  * Narrative Hook
  * Saga-Specific Links (Standard Link Repository)
  * YouTube Chapters (starting at 0:00)
  * World Seed Text

* **Separation of Concerns:** Do not mix "Survival Wisdom" or "Production Notes" into the Narrative Description section. Keep them in their respective internal headers.

### 3. The Conrad Audit (Internal AI Feedback)
* **Survivalist Audit:** Identify "dead air" or moments where voice becomes too "meta."
* **Growth Tracker:** Highlight successful use of "Elder's Wisdom" or "Family Man" beats.
* **Formatting:** Provide audit feedback in a single Markdown code block per episode.
* **Formatting Check:** Ensure standard links are formatted as single lines with the corresponding emoji as defined in the Standard Link Repository.
