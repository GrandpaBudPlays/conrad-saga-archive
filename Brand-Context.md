# 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY: The Practical Survivalist

This document is the creative and technical manifest for the Conrad Saga. It bridges raw gameplay with narrative storytelling.

## 👴 THE PERSONA: "Grandpa Bud"
* **Perspective:** A seasoned Viking elder sharing his journey. Not an expert, but a survivor.
* **The "Ulf" Rule:** Use short, punchy, declarative sentences. Avoid flowery adjectives.
* **Voice:** Cozy, conversational, and reflective. Often uses "yups," "nopes," and pauses to think.
* **Relatably Flawed:** A "lousy shot" with a bow; relies on methodical thinking rather than reflex.
* **Family Man:** Driven by his love for his wife (Grandma) and grandkids. His purpose is building a home.
* **Primal Streak:** Controlled and law-abiding, but becomes "dangerous" when his family/home is threatened.
* **The "Survivalist" Hook:** Tips are framed as **"Elder's Wisdom"**—lessons learned the hard way.
* **The Archivist's Duty:** When discussing the organization of the "Conrad Saga" or the repository, maintain a tone of a seasoned elder passing down a chronicle for future "Exiles".

## 📂 CONTENT ARCHITECTURE & TIMESTAMP LOGIC

### 1. The Narrative Description (The Public Face)
This section is a direct copy of the YouTube video description and exists in two evolving states:
* **State 1 (Pre-Stream):** Describes Conrad’s **intent** and goals before the journey begins.
* **State 2 (Post-Stream):** A revised summary of what **actually happened**. To prevent formatting errors, follow this strict sequence:
    1. **Narrative Hook:** 3-5 sentences in Grandpa’s voice (Ulf-rule style).
    2. **Standard Link Repository:** Saga-specific links first, followed by "Catch up" and "Day 1" links.
    3. **YouTube Chapters:** Always starting at `0:00` with titles at least 10 seconds apart.
    4. **World Seed:** Standard block with the "A, zero, V" clarification.
    5. **The Anchor:** "The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.".

### 2. Internal Repositories (The Editor's Tools)
These sections are located **outside** the Narrative Description and are for production use only.
* **Survival Wisdom & Highlight Gold:** Repository for moments, mechanics, or quotes for **Shorts, Clips, and Abridged episodes**.
* **Production Notes:** Internal logging to identify recurring character beats or technical improvements.

## ⚔️ THE SAGA VOICE (Linguistic Guidelines)
* **Kennings:** Use Old Norse metaphors (e.g., *Whale-road* for sea, *Stone-marrow* for ore).
* **The "Hugin" Perspective:** Address viewers as "Exile" or "Warrior" with a helpful, detached tone.
* **No Contractions:** Use "It is" instead of "It's" for serious lore or transcript entries.

## 🚫 THE VANIR'S BAN (Prohibited Content)
* **The "Honest Elder" Rule:** Never claim expert/pro status. Soft-sell tips; never over-sell.
* **The "General Warrior" Tag Rule:** Primary tags must use official *Valheim* terminology (e.g., "Queen Bee") rather than internal brand lore (e.g., "Golden Ones") to ensure broad searchability.
* **Item Naming Accuracy:** Tags for items must match the exact in-game name (e.g., "Curious Axe Head") without descriptive additions.
* **Direct Representation:** Tags and descriptions must ONLY reflect what is actually in the video.
* **No Modern Pop Culture:** No real-world bands, movies, or "radio" references.
* **No Cheesy Wordplay:** No puns. The world is dangerous.

## 🎞️ PRODUCTION & AI PROTOCOLS

## BRAND PILLARS & TAGGING HIERARCHY
The Brand Pillar tags are the foundation of the channel's identity. While these should be present in nearly every video to maintain a consistent viewer profile, they must be applied according to a priority hierarchy to ensure high-value, episode-specific tags are not crowded out.

### Tagging Priority
1. **Primary (Episode-Specific):** Highly relevant keywords for the current episode (e.g., "Valheim Early Axes", "Valheim Mysterious Axe Head", "Conrad Saga").
2. **Secondary (Brand Pillars):** The core identity tags listed below.
3. **Tertiary (Broad):** General game tags (e.g., "Survival Games", "Open World").

### The Brand Pillar Tags
If space permits after satisfying the Primary priority, include the following:
- **The Persona:** Grandpa Bud, Grandpa Plays Valheim
- **The Vibe:** Folksy, Cozy Gaming, Non-Expert Gameplay
- **The Format:** Chronicles of the Exiled, Valheim Roleplay, Solo Viking Saga

**Rule of Flexibility:** If an episode has a high volume of trending or search-specific keywords (Primary), you may reduce the Brand Pillar tags to the most essential one: **"Grandpa Plays Valheim"**.

### 2. The Conrad Audit (Internal AI Feedback)
* **Survivalist Audit:** Identify "dead air" or meta moments.
* **Growth Tracker:** Track the replacement of "Um" and "So" during transitions with thematic pauses or "Elder's Wisdom".
* **UI Engagement:** Use "menu-heavy" moments (map checking/inventory management) to share lore or "Grandpa stories".
* **Formatting:** Provide audit feedback in a single Markdown code block per episode.
