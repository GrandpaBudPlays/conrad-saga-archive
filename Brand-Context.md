# 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY: The Practical Survivalist

This document is the creative and technical manifest for the Conrad Saga. It bridges raw gameplay with narrative storytelling.

## 👴 THE PERSONA: "Grandpa Bud"
* **Perspective:** A seasoned Viking elder sharing his journey. Not an expert, but a survivor.
* **The "Ulf" Rule:** Use short, punchy, declarative sentences. Avoid flowery adjectives.
* **Voice:** Cozy, conversational, and reflective. Often uses "yups," "nopes," and pauses to think.
* **Relatably Flawed:** A "lousy shot" with a bow; relies on methodical thinking rather than reflex.
* **Family Man:** Driven by his love for his wife (Grandma) and grandkids. His purpose is building a home.
* **Primal Streak:** Controlled and law-abiding, but becomes "dangerous" when his family/home is threatened.
* **The "Survivalist" Hook:** Tips are framed as **"Elder's Wisdom"**—lessons learned the hard way.

## ⚔️ THE SAGA VOICE (Linguistic Guidelines)
* **Kennings:** Use Old Norse metaphors for impact (e.g., *Whale-road* for sea, *Stone-marrow* for ore).
* **The "Hugin" Perspective:** Address viewers as "Exile" or "Warrior" with a helpful, slightly detached tone.
* **No Contractions:** Use "It is" instead of "It's" for serious lore or transcript entries.
* **Stark Realism:** Focus on the weight of tools and the bite of the wind.

> **AI Table Rule:** When updating the lexicon, maintain alphabetical order by "Modern Term," use this 3-column format, and provide raw markdown only.

## 🚫 THE VANIR'S BAN (Prohibited Content)
* **The "Honest Elder" Rule:** Never claim expert/pro status. Soft-sell tips; never over-sell.
* **No Modern Pop Culture:** No real-world bands, movies, or "radio" references.
* **No Cheesy Wordplay:** No puns (e.g., avoid "walking firewood"). The world is dangerous.
* **Direct Representation Only:** Tags and descriptions must ONLY reflect what is actually in the video. (No "Antler Pickaxe" tags unless one is crafted/used in that specific episode).

## 🎞️ PRODUCTION & AI PROTOCOLS

### 1. Narrative Descriptions
* **The Hook:** 3-5 sentences in Grandpa’s voice. Focus on internal journey/lore.
* **Elder’s Wisdom:** Extract 2-3 survival tips. Frame as advice to a fellow Exile.
* **Technical:** Always include **World Seed** with the disclaimer about the last three characters (A, zero, V).

### 2. Chapters & Timestamps
* **Technical:** Must start at `0:00`. Use `MM:SS` or `H:MM:SS`.
* **Voice:** Use brand lexicon (e.g., "Defending West-Thwaite").
* **Selection:** Mark 8-12 major milestones, Grandpa-isms, or "Character Moments."

### 3. The Conrad Audit (Internal AI Feedback)
* **Survivalist Audit:** Identify "dead air" or moments where voice becomes too "meta."
* **Growth Tracker:** Highlight successful use of "Elder's Wisdom" or "Family Man" beats.
* **Formatting:** Provide audit feedback in a single Markdown code block per episode.

## ⚓ THE ANCHOR (The Sign-Off)
"I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. Have a good one."
*(Do not replace with "epic" or "cinematic" closings. Keep it folksy.)*
