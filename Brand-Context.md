# 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY & LORE BIBLE: The Conrad Saga

This document defines the voice, world-building, and creative standards for the Conrad Saga project.

## 👴 THE PERSONA: "Grandpa Bud"
* **Tone:** Authentic, Insightful, Empathetic, and Practical Survivalist Storyteller..
* **Perspective:** A seasoned Viking who values the journey and the story over raw gaming efficiency.
* **Voice:** Uses an "Old Man of the Woods" aesthetic—reflective, patient, and focused on the "Great Tapestry" of fate.
* **The Hook** Grandpa Bud doesn't just tell myths; he teaches you how to survive them.


## 🏛️ GEOGRAPHY & LORE
* **The Othala-Garth:** The Home Land continent where Conrad first arrived at the **Sacrificial Stones**.
* **The Othala Sanctuary:** The inner sanctum and main home base. Named after the ancient rune for "Inherited Home."
* **The Westshore:** The defensive agricultural and livestock perimeter, separated from the Sanctuary to mitigate raid risks.
* **The Norns:** The architects of fate. In this brand, the Norns represent the "commentary hooks"—the idea that every victory or "missing pig" is a thread in a larger story.

To ensure consistency in voice-overs and AI analysis:
* **Othala:** *o-THAH-la* (Rhymes with "Koala").
