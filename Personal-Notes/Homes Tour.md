# Project: Valheim Legacy Build Tours

## Video Option 1: The "Grandpa’s Greatest Hits" Montage
**Concept:** A high-speed, high-value architectural tour of homes built outside the main series.
**Format:** Rapid-fire walkthrough (approx. 7 minutes).
**Pacing:** ~20 seconds per build.
**Key Features:**
* Authority Builder: Proves veteran status/deep history with the game.
* Visual Variety: Shows builds from various biomes (Plains, Mistlands) not yet seen in the series.
* Tech Specs: Use DaVinci Resolve "Cross Dissolves" and "Dynamic Zoom" for smooth transitions between homes.
* Structure: 
    - Intro (30s)
    - The Tour (6m) 
    - Finale/Favorite Build (30s)

## Video Option 2: "The Restoration" (The Favorite Build)
**Concept:** A slow, cozy, cinematic deep-dive into the Meadow/Plains border village.
**Tone:** "Grandpa daydreaming of the past"—nostalgic, peaceful, and emotional.
**Format:** Slow-paced atmospheric feature (approx. 5 minutes).
**Narrative Elements:**
* Restoration Story: Rebuilding a ruined village into a thriving homestead.
* The Family Legacy: Dedicated buildings for grandkids (Rumi and Iris).
* The Border Contrast: The safety of the Meadows (bees, chickens, pigs) vs. the danger of the Plains (watchtower, wolves, Lox).
**Audio Strategy:**
* Music-forward: Heavy reliance on biome-specific Valheim scores.
* Minimalist Vocals: "Thought-bubble" style narration; reflections on memories rather than technical steps.
* Sound Design: Layered environmental audio (cracking fire, buzzing bees, howling wolves).
**Visual Style:**
* Softened midtone details in DaVinci for a "memory" glow.
* Long cross-dissolves and static, "breathing" camera shots.

## Technical & Legal Reminders
* Music: Valheim soundtrack is generally safe for creator use in Valheim-related videos; expect "Content ID Claims" but not "Strikes."
* DaVinci Resolve: Download the "Fairlight Sound Library" for SFX; use the `***` search hack to see all assets.
* Grouping: Organize clips by Biome; use 3-second Constant Power crossfades to blend music tracks during transitions.
