**Title:** The Silver Long-Walk: Conrad's Exile (Saga 4 Ep. 53) | Grandpa Plays Valheim

**Intro Recap & Goals:**
The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.
The peaks are calling. We left a king's ransom in frost-tears back in the high snows of episode forty-three. My back may be old, but the forge is hungry. Today, we trudge back into the cold to bring that ore home.78

**Description:**
Conrad is heading back to the high peaks. We have a mountain of frost-tears (silver) sitting on the slopes from ten episodes ago. The forge has been cold for too long. It is time to haul that heavy ore down the mountain. I hope the wolves are sleeping today. My legs aren't what they used to be for this climb.

In this chronicle, Conrad returns to the mountain biome to retrieve silver ore mined in Episode 43. I focus on the logistical challenge of transporting heavy resources across difficult terrain. The journey involves navigating steep slopes, managing stamina in the snow, and defending the haul from mountain predators. It is a slow, steady trek back to the safety of the lower lands.
