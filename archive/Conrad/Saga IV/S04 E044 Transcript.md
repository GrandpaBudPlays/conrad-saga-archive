> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:04.960,0:00:12.080
Hey everybody, welcome back. I'm 
Grandpa Bud. We're playing ballad today.

0:00:12.080,0:00:21.360
Conrad is considering his options for the

0:00:21.360,0:00:26.640
livestock pens and whether or not it's going to

0:00:26.640,0:00:38.480
work for him to move that to the 
west shore. So far, we got three

0:00:43.680,0:00:50.240
We got sorry can't not move around and 
talk at the same time. So far we've

0:00:50.240,0:00:56.080
got two bores being tamed. Uh I think what 
we're going to do next is head back there,

0:00:56.080,0:01:06.480
finish out the house and uh the 
pin and put a moat around the pin.

0:01:12.000,0:01:28.880
Probably put a boat around 
the pin on the out building.

0:01:39.040,0:01:43.680
kind of need some more

0:01:43.680,0:01:49.840
wood.

0:01:49.840,0:01:58.240
So, as long as we don't get those guys 
all excited, they should continue to tame

0:02:01.520,0:02:12.640
Oh, we got a wood stack over there. Let's 
just grab that. Well, let's get these.

0:02:12.640,0:02:22.960
Might as well grab these uh dead logs here. 
I thought we'd picked up all this wood.

0:02:26.080,0:02:43.040
Just don't want to get those bores all 
excited and have it slow down our taming.

0:02:43.040,0:02:47.120
It's going to rain today. I'd 
really like to get this done

0:02:47.120,0:02:57.440
before the rain sets in if it 
is. I don't want to have to um

0:02:57.440,0:03:13.920
repair the weathered wood.

0:03:13.920,0:03:18.720
But we'll go through wood pretty quick like this.

0:03:23.520,0:03:44.080
One more. Come on. Come on. There we go.

0:03:44.080,0:03:47.840
There. We're not looking into 
the sun. That's much better.

0:03:55.280,0:04:00.080
So, this eve just makes it a 
little bit easier to put the

0:04:00.080,0:04:14.640
uh roof on the building along with Let's 
do a 45 this time. What do you say?

0:04:30.000,0:04:36.560
uh along with providing a nice finished look.

0:04:36.560,0:04:42.080
I'm so envious of the people that can

0:04:42.080,0:04:50.080
do this live streaming and at the same time. 
I think it's just freaking amazing. Is that

0:04:50.080,0:05:12.000
a oak tree? If it is, we're going to grab 
it. And it is. Let's take this guy down.

0:05:12.000,0:05:13.520
No, we'll get out of the way.

0:05:18.960,0:05:25.680
See, lots of resin. I'm not so sure about the

0:05:25.680,0:05:33.200
acorns, though. I'd love to have more acorns.

0:05:33.200,0:05:39.120
Yeah, I don't see any acorns.

0:06:27.840,0:06:33.200
Well, that's not even 50 wood yet,

0:06:33.200,0:06:42.080
But I do like that extra fine wood.

0:06:42.080,0:06:58.000
Let's look at just tearing down this building.

0:07:57.760,0:08:02.320
I would think the whole thing 
would be coming down by now,

0:08:02.320,0:08:16.000
but I guess we missed that bar brace. Ah, 
we can use this stuff for livestock feed.

0:08:16.000,0:08:20.960
Now we have more than we can 
carry. So, we'll be back.

0:08:27.280,0:08:35.600
Yeah. Yeah.

0:08:35.600,0:08:47.680
Guess we should eat.

0:08:56.880,0:09:03.120
Not a mix and match.

0:09:03.120,0:09:14.560
There we go.

0:09:20.240,0:09:29.280
Looks like that's too wide for um

0:09:29.280,0:09:34.240
a bridge. Maybe

0:09:34.240,0:09:39.920
we won't need one of those.

0:12:31.920,0:12:42.000
All right, let's run back and grab 
that stuff that we left behind.

0:12:42.000,0:12:44.080
Wonder what he was squawking about.

0:12:46.480,0:12:54.560
Might as well grab this one, too.

0:12:54.560,0:13:00.240
All right. Where'd we leave that?

0:13:00.240,0:13:08.080
Oh, I know. It was way over there.

0:14:39.040,0:15:08.400
Okay, we'll have a lot to come back to There.

0:15:14.880,0:15:22.480
I've yet to come up with the idea 
of a chimney that I really like.

0:15:22.480,0:15:34.480
That's just not quite enough and that's 
too much. But we're going to do that.

0:15:58.320,0:16:09.200
The funny thing about this X-frame 
chimney, I like the way it looks. Um,

0:16:09.200,0:16:20.080
and I would think that it would 
provide additional airflow,

0:16:20.080,0:16:22.720
but it doesn't seem to uh do anything for

0:17:08.320,0:17:18.640
Can't quite get there. There we 
go. That's it. Let's do the 45 here

0:17:18.640,0:17:21.760
and there.

0:17:29.680,0:17:46.160
Get up there.

0:18:15.600,0:18:26.320
We They need to give them some more food.

0:18:26.320,0:18:33.360
They're going to get all excited.

0:18:33.360,0:18:40.960
You guys can have it all.

0:19:13.520,0:19:22.320
Can't see deadly looking into the sun like that.

0:19:22.320,0:19:28.960
Nope. I don't want it to stick 
down like that. There we go.

0:19:30.880,0:19:47.520
Is that the right looks right?

0:19:47.520,0:19:54.240
There we go. There.

0:20:12.560,0:20:20.720
All right, let's build a little scaff.

0:20:20.720,0:20:39.200
I'm almost sure we're going 
to have to have somehow.

0:20:39.200,0:20:44.800
Yeah.

0:20:44.800,0:20:51.120
So, that doesn't look right. That looks 
unfinished. So, we'll add to that.

0:20:55.040,0:21:09.120
tempted to add a row of beams 
across the top. We'll see.

0:21:09.120,0:21:14.000
So, they're taming again, but I 
don't know when they stop. So,

0:21:14.000,0:21:20.240
we lost a little bit of time there. We still 
got another day's worth of work here at least.

0:21:26.400,0:21:36.560
So if we spend time in that building, 
hopefully that is far enough

0:21:36.560,0:21:47.280
away that when we're spending time 
around them livestock, we're not actually

0:21:47.280,0:21:54.240
going to trigger a raid. I don't know. I 
need to look up the the details on that. So,

0:21:54.240,0:22:13.200
right now I'm just going on I hope it 
works, which is always a great plan.

0:22:13.200,0:22:18.560
Probably going to use up 
a lot of the rock we have.

0:22:21.920,0:22:25.920
When we build the breeder, I'm 
thinking of doing a stone tower

0:22:25.920,0:22:35.760
breeder just for fun because we 
haven't done the stone tower.

0:22:35.760,0:22:45.040
Haven't done that much stone 
building at all. So, we'll see.

0:22:56.720,0:23:10.000
Let's run back up the hill and grab that remaining 
wood that we uh cut down that big oak tree.

0:23:48.000,0:23:57.440
probably aren't going to need that there anymore.

0:23:57.440,0:24:04.480
Anything I cut down over there feels like 
it's going to roll into the ocean on me. So,

0:24:04.480,0:24:10.800
I'm going to switch sides. Besides, this 
will keep us closer to the animals and

0:24:10.800,0:24:23.120
shorten the breeding time. We might be 
able to get a chimney on here right now.

0:24:23.120,0:24:32.880
How about a 45 bridge? Can we get it 
to stick right there? And then let's

0:24:32.880,0:24:53.600
not make it look like it's floating. So we'll do

0:24:53.600,0:25:00.560
not crazy about that, but

0:25:00.560,0:25:03.360
it's not terrible.

0:25:06.080,0:25:26.400
It's always a compromise.

0:25:48.240,0:26:02.960
I like that a little better. Kind of 
gives it a just a tad more polished look.

0:26:02.960,0:26:28.640
Something doesn't feel right. That feels better.

0:26:44.240,0:26:50.240
eaten up on my uh workbench.

0:26:50.240,0:26:54.800
Don't appreciate it.

0:27:01.120,0:27:09.360
See if maybe we can get a multi tree drop.

0:27:09.360,0:27:20.880
Nope.

0:27:20.880,0:27:23.200
Yep, we did.

0:27:38.000,0:27:50.800
There's another one.

0:27:54.480,0:28:13.840
And I believe we got another one or two.

0:29:00.480,0:29:09.760
It'll be interesting to see if once uh 
if we get hit with the raid down here.

0:29:09.760,0:29:32.800
Does it have a wide enough scope 
that it picks out our livestock, too?

0:29:59.920,0:30:06.880
Yeah, it's going to be too 
long. So, we won't do that.

0:30:06.880,0:30:16.000
Oh, I know. One of the things we were looking 
at is those corners don't look quite right.

0:30:16.000,0:30:28.240
That's better.

0:31:56.880,0:32:04.720
I don't know that I'm ever going 
to cook here, but just to uh

0:32:04.720,0:32:11.280
give it the right aesthetic, we'll drop one in.

0:32:11.280,0:32:13.520
H That's what I was afraid of.

0:32:16.080,0:32:27.840
It's not out of wood. It got smoked 
out. So, it's not getting enough air.

0:32:27.840,0:32:33.520
I thought we cleared out.

0:32:33.520,0:32:42.000
Maybe we didn't.

0:32:42.000,0:32:56.720
I think that'll help. Now I think we can put in

0:32:56.720,0:33:08.640
complete the look there. And let's go 
ahead and take out that beam right there.

0:33:16.720,0:33:21.840
And we got a piece of wood way 
up in there. I think I'm going

0:33:21.840,0:33:29.600
to have to stand in the fire to 
get it. I don't want to do that.

0:33:29.600,0:33:34.080
How about

0:33:34.080,0:33:36.720
See if this will reach it.

0:33:40.240,0:33:47.840
Yeah,

0:33:47.840,0:34:03.600
that's better.

0:34:03.600,0:34:05.520
It went out again.

0:34:07.440,0:34:14.160
Did we run out of wood or did it go out?

0:34:14.160,0:34:23.360
It's getting choked out. That's 
too bad. I thought for sure

0:34:23.360,0:34:31.040
that that would be a plenty of

0:34:31.040,0:34:34.160
of oxygen for it to clear.

0:34:54.880,0:35:00.000
Surely that will be

0:35:16.240,0:35:29.840
It's like we're still taming.

0:35:29.840,0:35:36.000
Let's go ahead and take this down.

0:35:36.000,0:35:48.560
Going to need a workbench.

0:35:48.560,0:35:55.520
Let's see. Maybe about here 
we're going to start our trench.

0:35:56.480,0:36:15.280
We may hit sea level and have 
a a moat with water in it.

0:36:15.280,0:36:22.480
that's going to run that direction, 
which it looks to me like it is.

0:36:22.480,0:36:34.240
Then I think we want to be more like out here.

0:36:34.240,0:36:41.040
See how it's angling off that way?

0:37:27.200,0:37:41.440
There's water level. We're not going deeper.

0:38:04.720,0:38:10.880
Let's jump up and see how Let's eat something

0:38:10.880,0:38:16.640
and then let's jump up.

0:38:25.200,0:38:38.560
So that's going to cut 
right in front of that gate.

0:38:38.560,0:38:43.680
Which that's okay.

0:38:43.680,0:38:45.680
Let's come out this far.

0:38:49.600,0:39:08.960
So maybe we can drop this on the ground.

0:39:08.960,0:39:14.320
Trying to get straight on with 
that. That's pretty close.

0:39:21.040,0:39:28.800
So, about the time we get to that piece of wood,

0:39:28.800,0:39:43.280
then we'll turn right.

0:39:43.280,0:40:07.200
Getting

0:40:07.200,0:40:10.480
a little too deep.

0:40:18.800,0:40:36.480
There's one.

0:40:59.680,0:41:04.560
That would be there by now.

0:41:04.560,0:41:10.720
Are we there yet?

0:41:10.720,0:41:16.960
Getting

0:41:16.960,0:41:34.240
close. Okay.

0:41:44.240,0:41:58.080
Getting

0:41:58.080,0:42:12.720
too deep again.

0:42:51.440,0:42:58.720
Now that we're here, doing this.

0:42:58.720,0:43:04.720
I'm thinking

0:43:04.720,0:43:20.800
maybe we go ahead and put our farm over here, too.

0:43:30.880,0:43:35.840
All right, that's enough for this day.

0:43:35.840,0:43:41.360
And we're past the pin, so we can turn.

0:43:41.360,0:44:00.240
Now, if we want to put the farm out here, 
too, we might want to keep going. Going

0:44:00.240,0:44:01.520
to want to fill that hole

0:44:36.400,0:44:43.760
That's the overflow. That's 
where we put the new ones.

0:44:43.760,0:44:51.600
All right, let's take this with us. And this.

0:44:51.600,0:45:20.640
And these Getting

0:45:20.640,0:45:29.360
way too much stuff in inventory. I can only 
hope that that sound of somebody beating on

0:45:29.360,0:45:51.440
something is one of those grings down in 
the ditch. I don't see anybody out there.

0:45:51.440,0:45:52.160
Yeah.

0:46:12.640,0:46:20.640
Probably want to fill that in.

0:46:43.840,0:46:48.480
Wrong key strokes multiple times there.

0:47:27.200,0:47:44.080
there. It almost looks normal again.

0:47:46.080,0:47:52.800
So, we're going to put

0:47:52.800,0:47:57.120
a farm in.

0:47:57.120,0:48:03.360
Let's take this a little further up.

0:48:03.360,0:48:09.040
Just up to here.

0:48:17.040,0:48:28.080
Are both of them? He is. He's not. 
All right. They need some more food.

0:48:28.080,0:48:35.040
I think we've got some over here.

0:48:35.040,0:48:37.840
Yeah. Let's take um

0:48:40.080,0:48:54.720
Let's do Let's do five. That'll give us six total.

0:48:54.720,0:49:03.520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't get all excited.

0:49:03.520,0:49:08.080
Should

0:49:08.080,0:49:25.760
have repaired the pickaxe while we were home.

0:50:14.000,0:50:37.440
Well, shucks. I want out.

0:50:37.440,0:50:44.560
Guess I'm going to go a little further. doesn't uh

0:50:44.560,0:51:05.760
look like we'd have much room for crops 
if we leave that building in place.

0:51:10.560,0:51:31.840
Can't get down to water level 
now, which is fine by me.

0:51:49.600,0:51:58.480
Let's give this a try now. See what that 
looks like. And then let's run and repair.

0:51:58.480,0:52:16.080
Come on. Out you go. There we go. Yeah, 
that'll give us plenty of room for

0:52:16.080,0:52:29.920
there. We go. Now we should start making babies.

0:52:56.080,0:52:58.320
We're out of wood.

0:53:00.160,0:53:07.360
I didn't know we put our wood. 
I guess we put it in here.

0:53:07.360,0:53:19.600
No, we got wood. No charcoal. That's 
the problem. Okay. Well, temporary.

0:53:19.600,0:53:24.560
Let's do a crafting table.

0:53:30.560,0:53:41.120
I don't know that I can pick that up yet. Need 
to get rid of. We'll leave that stone in here

0:53:41.120,0:53:50.560
and we should go plant. That gives us three 
spots. And we'll leave the knife in here.

0:54:43.200,0:54:56.960
I just hope that this is far enough 
away that it's not triggering

0:54:56.960,0:55:07.200
us being home or, you know, 
triggering a raid when we're at the

0:55:12.080,0:55:17.520
livestock pins.

0:55:17.520,0:55:28.400
Just a quick repair and we're out of here.

0:56:01.520,0:56:06.160
I'm so sorry. Forgot to mute.

0:56:12.480,0:56:35.360
Let's hope those drugs kick in soon. 
Then I can quit doing that all together.

0:56:36.080,0:56:40.560
prefer that this moat

0:56:40.560,0:57:02.720
be square unlike other mo.

0:57:02.720,0:57:04.160
There we go.

0:57:06.800,0:57:27.280
I thought we could get deeper.

0:59:06.320,0:59:16.560
the out building just hanging on the edge there.

0:59:16.560,0:59:22.160
That's about almost made it. I think 
we're running short on stamina.

0:59:24.080,0:59:29.040
Get up there. There we go.

0:59:29.040,0:59:40.240
So, if we do a 90 from here, it's going to 
be right down that line. Nope. We need to go

0:59:40.240,0:59:45.680
at least as far as this fence.

0:59:45.680,0:59:59.920
I think that fence will fall in. 
If we go as far as that fence.

0:59:59.920,1:00:12.000
Yeah, that ought to be about right. Once 
this fence falls in on us, we're there.

1:00:48.320,1:00:50.880
So, it's not going to fall in on us.

1:01:06.240,1:01:11.840
Let's go ahead and eat.

1:01:11.840,1:01:25.840
Get that stamina back so that we 
can get out of here. Almost. Got it.

1:01:25.840,1:01:33.040
I'm almost sure we're far enough.

1:01:33.040,1:01:38.240
Let's sight right down that 
right right there. Yeah,

1:01:38.240,1:01:47.440
that's going to be past the house. We'll 
give all this room for a nice big field.

1:02:01.920,1:02:10.000
All right, here we go.

1:05:02.720,1:05:06.560
We're down to the water level again.

1:05:09.680,1:05:18.640
Okay, time to get out of here and

1:05:18.640,1:05:29.040
see where we are. Every bear and rest for 
the night. We're so close. We are so close.

1:05:31.840,1:05:52.400
We should cut over couple of hits 
so that it intersects properly.

1:06:00.320,1:06:05.280
Sorry about that. I think I bumped the mic.

1:06:05.280,1:06:10.560
All right, let's repair.

1:06:10.560,1:06:18.160
Oh, we forgot to plant. Let's be 
sure and do that in the morning.

1:06:52.080,1:06:58.800
I kind of like the looks of that little hut.

1:06:58.800,1:07:03.680
All right.

1:07:03.680,1:07:07.360
Can't see many rocks, which 
would be a pro bit of a problem,

1:07:07.360,1:07:16.880
but let's go with oak sampling saplings first.

1:07:16.880,1:07:21.520
One,

1:07:21.520,1:07:28.000
two, and we're out of oak saplings.

1:07:28.000,1:07:31.840
So, let's step out here just a little bit.

1:07:36.880,1:07:54.800
And now we've got birch.

1:08:22.400,1:08:29.680
Don't want to get too close to those rocks.

1:08:40.320,1:08:59.200
and I certainly don't want 
to dig one up in the trench.

1:08:59.200,1:09:07.040
Since we have over a hundred of these seeds, 
I'm not too worried about them. Hopefully,

1:09:07.040,1:09:25.680
we don't kill any, but if we do, 
well, that's just the way things go.

1:09:31.760,1:09:39.440
And we're out. Okay, we've planted our trees

1:09:39.440,1:09:44.960
and hopefully they all grow 
up to be big, beautiful trees,

1:09:44.960,1:09:51.600
especially the white ones. And 
we can just cut them back down.

1:10:38.000,1:10:40.720
Come on, get out of there. Oh, good deal.

1:12:00.400,1:12:06.080
Here

1:12:06.080,1:12:22.640
we go.

1:12:22.640,1:12:54.720
Okay. It's not my intent to 
trap things down here. So

1:12:54.720,1:13:20.800
now if we end up in there, We can just run out.

1:13:20.800,1:13:41.600
Oh, we're inside of Where's the crafting 
station? I thought we uh we got rid of this.

1:13:41.600,1:13:49.440
Like I said, I must have left one.

1:14:20.400,1:14:25.520
Must have left this one in the house.

1:14:29.280,1:14:36.480
which I think I'm going to put 
this house back the way it was.

1:14:36.480,1:14:53.520
Get rid of that addition that we did.

1:15:07.040,1:15:11.600
And let's go back to

1:15:11.600,1:15:18.240
I think those are 45s.

1:15:57.440,1:15:57.940
Yeah.

1:16:16.880,1:16:24.720
Oh, I got rid of the crafting 
station. Let's put it outside for now.

1:16:24.720,1:16:30.240
And we're going to get rid 
of it right away because

1:16:30.240,1:16:48.400
don't want to trigger a raid.

1:18:13.600,1:18:27.360
Hey, we already got one little piggy. What do you 
know? Two little piggies. Three little piggies.

1:18:27.360,1:18:30.400
It's a great start.

1:19:02.240,1:19:07.520
Hate to do that, but I think we need to.

1:20:10.960,1:20:28.880
Okay.

1:21:49.040,1:22:06.640
Don't roll in. Here

1:22:06.640,1:22:15.840
we go. Let's get a little more and 
then we're probably going to head back.

1:22:15.840,1:22:19.600
Don't let it fall on you.

1:22:24.720,1:22:43.600
Thought we got all three of them at 
once. I was going to be really impressed.

1:22:53.200,1:22:56.480
Not going to put the stockade around the entire

1:22:56.480,1:23:07.200
area. My main goal is to get the 
livestock protected from archers.

1:23:07.200,1:23:12.720
And then we'll need to put in a 
temporary, you know, like we did

1:23:12.720,1:23:24.880
over there. We want to we need to put in some 
kind of bridge that an animal can walk across

1:23:24.880,1:23:29.760
where we drop in a temporary bridge.

1:23:29.760,1:23:36.000
I'm not making sense to myself because I haven't 
decided what that is. I was thinking about that.

1:23:36.960,1:23:42.880
I think a pig will go up steps.

1:23:42.880,1:23:53.920
If not, there's ways that we 
can break it to make it work.

1:23:53.920,1:24:01.440
But the more we work on that area with 
the workbench, the more likely it is

1:24:01.440,1:24:13.280
that we get a raid. And that's what I want to 
avoid. It's the whole reason we're doing it.

1:24:13.280,1:24:17.280
All right, going to take a quick break. Oh,

1:24:17.280,1:24:26.960
look at that. We got a area of the house that 
got pounded in the raid that we need to repair.

1:24:26.960,1:24:33.600
I didn't notice that before.

1:24:35.840,1:24:41.360
raid was really discouraging.

1:24:41.360,1:24:48.320
Maybe because I wasn't as 
prepared as I should have been.

1:24:48.320,1:25:01.280
All right, short break and I'll be right back.

1:26:08.480,1:26:17.200
Actually, let's look at wrapping it up right 
here. Um, we'll stop this one. We'll pick it up

1:26:17.200,1:26:27.840
in the morning and um look at moving the farm over 
there. Looks like we can harvest the crops. We'll

1:26:27.840,1:26:37.520
finish that stockade and uh level some ground 
and create an area to replant so that we've

1:26:37.520,1:26:47.520
got plenty of turnups. Once we get the turnups in 
the ground and that stockade, then I think we can

1:26:47.520,1:26:53.600
move on and get that silver down the 
hill and start building out the area

1:26:53.600,1:26:59.120
in the black forest where we're going to 
repeat a lot of the same stuff. We'll put

1:26:59.120,1:27:09.360
a moat around that area, put up a stock 
a so that we can smelt without issue.

1:27:10.480,1:27:19.840
and get started on smelting that s silver and uh 
moving us from the iron age into the silver age.

1:27:19.840,1:27:26.640
With that, I'm Grandpa Bud. We're playing Valheim 
and thank you so much for joining us. We do.
