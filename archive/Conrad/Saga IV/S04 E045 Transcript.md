## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
One shard down. The ruins finally gave up the Curious Axe Head. The shadows of the mountains reached into the Meadows and took the pigs, but they left behind a trail to something stronger.

Conrad has retreated to the Westshore, pausing his carpentry to hunt for the fabled Early Axes. With new peaks sighted on the home horizon, the old man longs for the cry of the wolf to break the silence of his exile. One shard is ours; the second won't stay hidden for long.

## ✨ SURVIVAL WISDOM & HIGHLIGHT GOLD
* [0:03:56] - **Inventory Discipline:** Always perform a final inventory check before heading out to ensure you have what is necessary and aren't carrying unnecessary weight like the cultivator during an exploration run.

* [0:06:55] - **Forward Planning:** When exploring distant lands, always carry materials for a portal (10 Greydwarf eyes, 20 Fine Wood, and 2 Surtling Cores) to ensure a safe path home.

* [0:12:00] - **Biome Awareness:** Watch for shifts in ground color; the transition from lush green to dried brown signals the Plains—a "No Fly Zone" where Deathsquitos and Fulings can end a run instantly for under-geared warriors.

* [0:14:11] - **World Generation Mechanics:** New items and structures from game updates (like the fabled Early Axes) only generate in areas of the world that have not been previously explored.

## 📀 Highlight Gold
* [0:01:10] - **Character Moment:** A humble moment of honesty where you admit to getting "Hild-er" and "Hild-a" confused, jokingly asking viewers not to tell your "other girlfriend".

* [0:04:30] - **Hearthside Reflection:** A rare "behind-the-scenes" moment where you discuss the effort of re-cataloging old streams and organizing the "Conrad Saga" for the audience.

* [0:11:00] - **Character Moment:** The "Grandpa-ism" of ignoring useful resources like deer meat and mushrooms because "if I start hunting deer and boars, we’ll never get anywhere in our search".

* [1:19:41] - **Action/Drama:** The long-awaited discovery of the Curious Axe Head shard within the ruins, marking a major milestone for the episode’s objective.

🎙️ Critical Speaker Growth Analysis
* Pacing & Flow The introduction is strong and thematic, setting the stakes for the "Early Axes" hunt. However, there is a significant pacing dip between 0:01:41 and 0:03:16 during the "Hildir/Hilda" portal confusion. While the mistake is folksy and on-brand, the silence while checking the map lasts a bit long.

    * Advice: Use these "menu-heavy" moments to share more "Elder’s Wisdom" or lore about the world to keep the narrative moving while your hands are busy with UI navigation.

* Filler Words & Habits You have a very natural, conversational flow, but there is a recurring reliance on "All right," "Um," and "So" when transitioning between tasks (e.g., at 0:05:33, 0:06:30, and 0:07:54).

* **Growth Area:** You often use "Uh" or "Dog on it" when you realize you've forgotten an item (like the portal eyes at 0:06:55). While this fits the "forgetful grandpa" persona perfectly, try to limit the frequency of "Um" during the actual travel segments to maintain the stoic, rhythmic feel of the "Ulf" rules.

* **Audience Engagement** The seed-sharing segment at the end of the narrative description is a fantastic engagement tool. In the transcript, you mention being "short six wood" for a portal. This would have been a great moment to ask the "Exiles" in the comments if they’ve ever been stranded just a few branches short of a way home, further bridging the gap between your journey and theirs.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:03.120,0:00:10.080
Welcome back. I'm Grandpa Bud. 
We're playing Valheim. Well,

0:00:10.080,0:00:16.080
the nons have woven yet another new 
thread into our cloth. The winds from

0:00:16.080,0:00:21.920
the mountains brought more than just the 
drakes that destroyed our sound of pigs.

0:00:22.720,0:00:30.000
It also brings whispers that an ancient weapon 
may be found in the abandoned buildings of the

0:00:30.000,0:00:39.920
mountains. As we've searched most of the buildings 
near us, we'll have to travel to new lands in

0:00:39.920,0:00:49.200
search of the fabled early axes. Today, Conrad 
is hunting for these old relics the al father

0:00:49.200,0:01:10.640
left in the ruins. Let's see what these shacks 
are hiding. And with that, let's get started.

0:01:10.640,0:01:20.800
All right, we left off. We were 
making a new area in the west shore,

0:01:20.800,0:01:31.440
but I think today we'll head out to the 
area where Hilda is. If I remember right,

0:01:31.440,0:01:39.360
that was Meadows. And uh Oh, 
come on, Hilda. Connect with me.

0:01:41.840,0:01:48.240
A no Hilda.

0:01:48.240,0:01:56.160
All right, let's check the map. 
See if I've got that wrong.

0:01:56.160,0:02:02.080
Oh, we didn't we didn't even 
mark what the portal was. So,

0:02:02.080,0:02:08.640
we've got a portal here that's called portal. 
We've got Hild to here that's called nothing.

0:02:11.520,0:02:17.440
And we got nothing in between.

0:02:17.440,0:02:26.640
Boy, I'm having the best luck with portals 
lately and having everything messed up.

0:02:26.640,0:02:31.280
Have I got the name wrong?

0:02:31.280,0:02:36.480
I'm almost sure that's what it's called, but

0:02:39.760,0:03:01.920
I could be mistaken.

0:03:01.920,0:03:16.320
Hill deer, not hill dah. So maybe 
if we fix that name, we can go.

0:03:16.320,0:03:26.800
Must have her confused with my other 
girlfriend. Don't tell her I got her name.

0:03:26.800,0:03:38.080
You know, I didn't even bother to 
check if it was day or night. So,

0:03:38.080,0:03:48.720
let's go back and go to sleep first 
because I think it's night time.

0:03:48.720,0:03:53.200
Let's also take a look at

0:03:53.200,0:03:55.520
what we've got in our inventory.

0:03:56.400,0:04:03.040
Uh, does it meet our needs? Are we carrying too 
much? All the kinds of things we should always

0:04:03.040,0:04:13.120
do before we run out. And then remember, 
we're in a rainstorm without our raincoat.

0:04:13.120,0:04:22.560
That's not inventory. Okay. Yeah, we want to clear 
some of this out. We don't want to take the uh

0:04:30.480,0:04:38.480
cultivator with us. Well, my head's not in the 
game at all. Give me a minute to reorient. I've

0:04:38.480,0:04:47.520
been spending a lot of time on We need to swap 
this out. I've been spending a whole lot of time

0:04:47.520,0:05:06.800
on trying to reatalog and organize these old 
streams and also cutting up some new clips.

0:05:06.800,0:05:13.120
Uh, good enough. We're running 
out of overflow room. We should

0:05:29.760,0:05:33.680
Holy cow.

0:05:33.680,0:05:38.400
All right. Um,

0:05:38.400,0:05:44.000
we're not going to need this. And 
we're not going to be keeping it

0:05:44.000,0:05:53.760
here. We don't need that. We can 
take it. I don't think we need it.

0:05:53.760,0:06:01.920
If I had ample storage, I'd get rid of 
some more of this stuff. Gonna have to

0:06:01.920,0:06:22.240
fix our storage problem. need to bring Well, 
we did bring some iron up here. No, we didn't.

0:06:22.240,0:06:30.640
Anyway, I think we're set. That 
should that should serve us well.

0:06:30.640,0:06:41.040
Now, we just need to eat food. 
And we need food. Another

0:06:41.040,0:06:43.440
go. Seems like we're really going through the

0:06:43.440,0:06:55.520
food quickly these days. And 
we should probably take a uh

0:06:55.520,0:07:07.600
dog on it. 14. should probably take a 
portal with us. Which means those eyes,

0:07:07.600,0:07:13.840
we're going to put them back 
cuz we need 10 of them. And

0:07:13.840,0:07:18.560
no,

0:07:18.560,0:07:22.720
take 10 out of here.

0:07:22.720,0:07:29.920
So, that should serve as our portal. And since 
I'm so forgetful, let's make sure that we can do

0:07:29.920,0:07:47.920
a portal. We're short. Six wood, I think. 
None there. We got 50 there. We need six.

0:07:47.920,0:07:54.480
That should do it. All right. Um,

0:07:54.480,0:08:04.640
let's double check. Yes, we can do the 
portal. Everything looks good. Now,

0:08:04.640,0:08:12.560
now we can begin our quest for the early access. 
So, the the fifth I don't know which anniversary

0:08:12.560,0:08:20.720
was it, the fifth anniversary. Anyway, the 
new patch came out. Lots to talk about. Oh,

0:08:20.720,0:08:29.840
this is a really small meadows. Let's head 
this way. Haven't explored any of this area.

0:08:29.840,0:08:39.120
Maybe we can find something there. I'm not 
sure what the distance we need to be from

0:08:39.120,0:08:46.320
areas that we haven't been to, but let's 
just kind of head towards this coastline.

0:08:48.160,0:08:57.120
and see if we can find abandoned buildings. I 
understand it's specific abandoned buildings,

0:08:57.120,0:09:03.440
but I haven't researched what they're 
supposed to look like. I figure if we

0:09:03.440,0:09:10.800
running across an abandoned building, it won't 
take us long to look in and see what's there.

0:09:10.800,0:09:14.400
And then maybe we'll find out.

0:09:20.240,0:09:23.920
what it looks like. So, today's going to be

0:09:23.920,0:09:33.120
a lot of running. Let's fire up 
fire up the old ether power. And

0:09:33.120,0:09:42.400
uh see if we can't make this a little bit faster 
trip for a while. Oh, look at all those bigs.

0:09:50.560,0:10:01.840
Oh, wish I had that one star back at the west 
shore because we could sure use it. Oh man,

0:10:01.840,0:10:09.680
I don't need deer. But look at the 
antlers on that guy. He's a good one.

0:10:14.800,0:10:27.680
I guess actually since uh we don't have 
any reserves right now, we might need that.

0:10:27.680,0:10:34.080
Nothing here. So, this isn't 
the right kind of building.

0:10:34.080,0:10:38.880
And I'm not going to bother picking up 
mushrooms and that kind of stuff. Let's

0:10:42.880,0:10:53.840
Let's just keep going. We'll be able to use.

0:10:53.840,0:11:02.320
Come back, biggy. We'll be 
able to use all of these

0:11:02.320,0:11:18.000
scrap leather and or meat. 
So, it's not exactly a waste.

0:11:18.000,0:11:26.240
We could probably use the deer meat, too. But if 
I start hunting deer and bores, we'll never we'll

0:11:26.240,0:11:36.640
never find out anything. We'll never get anywhere 
in our search for the early axes. Uh what I have

0:11:36.640,0:11:46.800
seen about the early ax is they look kind of cool 
and the fact that you can have the early access.

0:11:46.800,0:11:54.720
Well, this is definitely not it.

0:11:54.720,0:12:00.960
You can use the early axes to cut down.

0:12:00.960,0:12:11.600
Oh, don't want to get too close, but 
I'm pretty sure that is the planes.

0:12:11.600,0:12:17.200
And we're not we're not ready for that. So,

0:12:17.200,0:12:30.080
let's double back here and try to cover part 
part of the ground we didn't cover before.

0:12:30.080,0:12:42.080
We also want to kind of scoot the edge.

0:12:42.080,0:12:50.400
Scoot the edge of the planes. But we 
don't want to get so close. We attention.

0:12:50.400,0:13:05.360
I think at this point if we saw a fueling he would 
take us down. I'm not sure we can even parry one.

0:13:05.360,0:13:12.480
So, just don't want to get too close to that.

0:13:12.480,0:13:20.720
And that looks like all planes. See how 
the ground shifts from being this nice

0:13:20.720,0:13:27.920
green lush to that kind of uh dried out 
look? That's what the planes look like.

0:13:30.240,0:13:36.640
Um, so we're going to have to 
find yet another area of meadows

0:13:36.640,0:13:46.080
to search because I think we've 
covered a great deal of this one.

0:13:46.080,0:13:54.400
And then we're probably not even outside the area

0:13:54.400,0:13:59.600
because if if the world's already generated,

0:13:59.600,0:14:02.880
you've

0:14:02.880,0:14:10.480
explored this part of the land. Everything 
close to where you explored is already set.

0:14:11.360,0:14:18.560
But the parts of the world that we haven't 
gotten close to, that's where new items like

0:14:18.560,0:14:24.880
the early axis can show up. And then I was 
saying that the advantage of the early axis

0:14:24.880,0:14:36.160
is we can chop these down before we have bronze. 
So, in that respect, it's kind of a game changer,

0:14:36.160,0:14:49.920
letting you get that gives you early access to the 
fine wood bow. So, you got some better weaponry.

0:14:49.920,0:15:04.960
I don't want to get too close. I can't tell 
when I peek up that hill. I think That is

0:15:04.960,0:15:13.840
I think that's a planes. And we get too 
close, we'll get a fueline or a mosquito.

0:15:13.840,0:15:22.800
And those giant mosquitoes are just deadly, 
especially for us at this at this point.

0:15:22.800,0:15:35.920
Okay, we've probably been here and this may not 
even be a new building. So, but we'll look inside.

0:15:35.920,0:15:40.640
And there's nothing here anyway. All right. I

0:15:40.640,0:15:46.080
think our best bet then is 
going to be to head back.

0:15:46.080,0:15:52.800
Well, let's take a look at this

0:15:52.800,0:15:58.960
land and see if there's much more in the way of

0:15:58.960,0:16:07.440
of meadows might be available to us

0:16:07.440,0:16:14.400
again. Wish I had that onestar 
bore back at my bore farm.

0:16:16.640,0:16:28.080
That would be great for breeding new bors.

0:16:28.080,0:16:39.600
Now we're at the black forest.

0:16:39.600,0:16:43.040
Those three trees grew pretty close together.

0:16:44.720,0:16:49.440
And there's mountains.

0:16:49.440,0:17:01.840
So if we need new mountains, we could probably 
go there. There might be a sliver of plains

0:17:01.840,0:17:09.600
between us and the mountains, but not bad. We 
could probably sneak through if we have to.

0:17:10.240,0:17:15.840
That's the kind of uh

0:17:15.840,0:17:19.600
risk we don't need to take yet. 
I think the mountains that we've

0:17:19.600,0:17:36.400
found are pretty extensive and we're 
not going to need to mess with it.

0:17:36.400,0:17:38.800
Cool little patch of sunlight.

0:17:48.240,0:18:04.880
Did we peek in that building and that building? 
I really don't think it's likely that that's a

0:18:04.880,0:18:07.920
very good prospect, but we're here. Let's look.

0:18:15.440,0:18:21.840
And yeah, we emptied this out already.

0:18:21.840,0:18:26.720
So, let's head for

0:18:26.720,0:18:33.520
our portal and let's put that on the map once we 
get there because now we don't even know where

0:18:33.520,0:19:00.400
it is. Another beehive. But do we need any more 
bees? I think we still have bees in storage. So,

0:19:00.400,0:19:14.000
well, that's one down and who 
knows how many more to go. Another

0:19:14.000,0:19:20.720
little side quest that we're going to do is

0:19:20.720,0:19:27.200
let me get a little closer.

0:19:27.200,0:19:35.120
The sound of that portal 
kind of drives me crazy. But

0:19:35.120,0:19:43.920
there we go. And if there is still a portal 
over there, I think we should run over and

0:19:43.920,0:19:51.280
see what it's called someday. Okay, another 
little side quest I thought we'd do. Once

0:19:51.280,0:20:03.120
we get the silver armor, I think it'd 
be fun to go do the smoldering tomb.

0:20:05.040,0:20:10.880
All right. So,

0:20:10.880,0:20:20.480
there's big sections up here that we haven't and 
there's a lot of land that we can run to. So,

0:20:20.480,0:20:27.920
I think what we should do is jump to the start 
and head up the coast this way and see what we can

0:20:27.920,0:20:35.920
find. We can go get that uh treasure out of that 
shipwreck we spotted when we were sailing. And

0:20:35.920,0:20:42.560
uh there's a lot of meadows here that 
we haven't gotten close to exploring.

0:20:42.560,0:20:54.400
I would think this area over here is a 
good candidate. Uh so we messed up again.

0:20:54.400,0:20:59.680
I messed up again and not setting. We 
took a portal with us, but we didn't

0:20:59.680,0:21:12.000
set a return point. Okay, so this is going 
to be start. And then if we have to drop

0:21:12.000,0:21:27.360
a temp portal, where's this connecting to right 
now? This is our mountains. Let's re Yeah, we can.

0:21:27.360,0:21:37.280
We're freezing. I can fix that. 
There we go. Now we're not freezing.

0:21:37.280,0:21:42.400
Let's jump back through this.

0:21:42.400,0:21:51.920
Going to do a quick rename. Uh

0:21:51.920,0:21:57.280
going to call this silver.

0:21:57.280,0:22:08.080
So now that's our return point. 
We're going to jump through here.

0:22:08.080,0:22:16.720
Did we mark this? Yeah, we marked it, but 
it's the empty one. So, let's change it to

0:22:16.720,0:22:19.920
silver.

0:22:19.920,0:22:31.200
And then let's go ahead and rename this silver.

0:22:31.200,0:22:36.320
That way we keep our traveling 
portal as blank and just makes

0:22:36.320,0:22:44.320
uh everything more confusing. No, it makes 
it easy for us to drop that portal with no

0:22:44.320,0:22:53.040
name and then we can jump through it. If we get 
in a bad position, you know, we can run for our

0:22:53.040,0:23:00.240
lives and try to drop a crafting station and a 
workbench. Turn around close to the workbench,

0:23:00.240,0:23:09.360
get within anywhere within that radius, which 
is like 20 mters, and drop our traveling portal.

0:23:09.920,0:23:16.720
with no name on it and then you don't have to 
rename it while you're running from the bad

0:23:16.720,0:23:25.840
guys. Now, the worst part would be if the bad guys 
decide they want to tear down your portal. Often

0:23:25.840,0:23:37.200
they'll tear down the workbench first, but it 
might give you an opportunity to keep from dying.

0:23:39.120,0:23:46.560
and you leave the portal behind. Like 
we typically always have a portal

0:23:46.560,0:23:51.920
that is our base portal where we're 
operating from and then we have our

0:23:51.920,0:23:57.760
travel portal. So if they destroy your 
travel portal, then you can at least go

0:23:57.760,0:24:06.400
back to your base portal and run back to 
where your traveling portal got destroyed.

0:24:07.040,0:24:12.560
Everything will be there. You'll be all 
set. All right. Anyway, we're going to be h

0:24:12.560,0:24:20.160
uh running around in the rain. So, let's change 
this back to start. That's going to be our base of

0:24:20.160,0:24:29.760
operations portal. If we die or lose our traveling 
portal, then we this will get us back closer.

0:24:31.120,0:24:35.840
So now the start is our

0:24:35.840,0:24:40.400
our safety net.

0:24:40.400,0:24:45.280
Okay, let's take a look at the map and 
we're going to be heading do north. Going

0:24:45.280,0:24:54.800
to try to knock this area out real 
quick and then move on to due west.

0:24:54.800,0:24:59.360
and all of this in the rain.

0:24:59.360,0:25:09.360
Let's drop this stuff off before we There 
we go. Leaving without my raincoat again.

0:25:09.360,0:25:22.000
You know what? It might be time 
for a reminder. Let's do this

0:25:22.000,0:25:31.120
and see how often I uh forget to take a look 
at it. Uh don't think I have any coal and I

0:25:31.120,0:25:42.800
don't have a kiln nearby so I can't do that. 
I was going to put up a sign to remind us.

0:25:42.800,0:25:54.080
All right, we got a full set of four trophies 
now. That's our veggies. There's our pork. And

0:25:54.080,0:26:03.760
let's put some of these scrap leather 
in here. And now that's a full set.

0:26:03.760,0:26:09.360
Filling up our storage so fast.

0:26:13.760,0:26:20.720
And that's why we built this extra one. We can use 
this, you know, in case we need a torch. It's a

0:26:20.720,0:26:31.360
little more wood than we need, but it's not bad. 
And let's just while we're here, let's repair.

0:26:31.360,0:26:35.760
And let's try this again.

0:26:44.080,0:26:53.680
Just a little housekeeping real quick. One second.

0:26:53.680,0:27:00.000
And we're back. I think, and 
I'm not sure exactly when,

0:27:00.000,0:27:12.800
but I'd like to start uh having a regular 
schedule for the streams, live streaming,

0:27:12.800,0:27:25.920
and then these side quests. If I get anchor in 
to go play, uh we'll do one of these side quests.

0:27:35.120,0:27:41.200
Well, here's our first building. I doubt 
that's the right one, but I don't know what

0:27:41.200,0:27:50.640
what we're supposed to be looking for. 
We picked up a little treasure anyway.

0:27:50.640,0:27:54.640
We should grab a five stone while we're going.

0:27:55.280,0:28:06.560
We might want to buff up our 
rested bonus at some point.

0:28:06.560,0:28:19.920
Oh, we don't need wood. I shouldn't shouldn't 
grab that. That's flint. I want some stone.

0:28:24.960,0:28:31.440
Got a building over there.

0:28:31.440,0:28:35.680
There's one.

0:28:35.680,0:28:42.560
All right, I'll deal with you guys.

0:28:42.560,0:28:48.160
Two for one. Didn't even need that last swing.

0:28:53.920,0:29:04.640
What a lovely storm we have here. Any bees? 
I don't want to run in there and get stung.

0:29:04.640,0:29:14.080
Somehow I don't think this is what we're 
looking for. We really don't need that flint.

0:29:14.080,0:29:17.600
Well, we don't need the neck. 
Well, I don't know. Yeah,

0:29:17.600,0:29:29.280
we don't need the flint. Yeah, we'll 
ditch it when we get short on space.

0:29:29.280,0:29:31.520
Guess we don't have to worry about being wet.

0:29:31.520,0:29:42.080
There's no staying dry in this weather. 
And I'm guessing there is nothing here.

0:29:42.080,0:30:05.440
Is that a chest? I can't see. No. No chest. Okay.

0:30:05.440,0:30:14.240
I'm really curious to try out these new 
axes. And then also I'm I'm wondering the

0:30:14.240,0:30:27.840
uh yeah the they would fall under the axe 
skill. So the other advantage is you could start

0:30:27.840,0:30:31.760
working on your axe skill early on.

0:30:33.280,0:30:40.240
All right,

0:30:40.240,0:30:56.320
guys. We're just out for a little Sunday stroll. 
We really didn't want to be messing with anybody.

0:30:56.320,0:31:00.480
Well, at least we're not sailing in this mess.

0:31:04.720,0:31:30.240
Must be time to eat cuz our 
stamina is next to nothing.

0:31:30.240,0:31:37.920
Lots of things that we could grab, 
but nothing that we really need.

0:31:37.920,0:31:41.360
Oh,

0:31:41.360,0:31:49.200
I would love to be able to see this huge

0:31:49.200,0:31:54.880
uh open area because there's almost 
always buildings in in this. So,

0:31:54.880,0:31:58.240
the rain's just killing our visibility.

0:32:00.160,0:32:08.960
I'm not seeing anything though.

0:32:08.960,0:32:11.520
We put it down. I was thinking about

0:32:11.520,0:32:22.000
uh putting on the wishbone, but we 
left it. And that kind of treasure

0:32:22.000,0:32:28.720
fun to find. I don't know that 
we're in need of it. Okay,

0:32:28.720,0:32:35.760
wasn't completely fruitless. 
We at least found a building.

0:32:35.760,0:32:47.040
We got ether again. Maybe we should use 
it cuz we keep running out of stamina.

0:32:50.560,0:32:57.040
Oh, the the door got ivied over.

0:32:57.040,0:33:08.080
All right, let's uh Well, we wanted rock. 
Let's trade in the flint. Flint's easy to

0:33:08.080,0:33:13.840
come by and not something that's 
in high demand for us right now.

0:33:16.080,0:33:21.440
All right, looks like we covered most of this. So,

0:33:21.440,0:33:32.800
we're just going to come on over here to the 
shore and continue on down the shoreline.

0:33:32.800,0:33:41.600
Lots more bors.

0:33:41.600,0:33:42.100
All

0:33:45.680,0:33:51.200
right, let's uh check out this runstone.

0:33:51.200,0:33:56.800
This land is hard and wild, but we 
who brought here are harder still.

0:33:56.800,0:34:09.200
I'll let you read it. I'm a real slow reader.

0:34:09.200,0:34:10.960
Think we've read this one before.

0:34:16.480,0:34:32.240
singing the praises of the boores. 
Uh they do really do a lot for us.

0:34:32.240,0:34:38.080
The leather they provide we use so many ways.

0:34:40.880,0:34:56.880
Oh, the rain's gone. How nice is that?

0:34:56.880,0:35:14.720
Black Forest troll. Uh, we don't need a troll, 
so we're just going to try to sneak by him.

0:35:14.720,0:35:21.360
And that's a lot of black forest. 
So, let's bring up our map.

0:35:21.360,0:35:29.520
Black forest, black forest, meadows. 
So, we're going to keep along this.

0:35:29.520,0:35:47.200
probably gonna end up um I know what 
let's do. Let's ether out of here.

0:35:47.200,0:35:51.360
He's going to see us

0:35:51.360,0:35:58.160
and we're going to try to get past him and 
hope we don't find his friend the bear.

0:36:00.560,0:36:04.640
We're back in the meadows.

0:36:04.640,0:36:18.480
And uh he's way back there,

0:36:18.480,0:36:25.200
but you know, we're going to run into a bear.

0:36:25.200,0:36:37.920
Lots of tin if we needed it. And 
there's a nice piece of copper.

0:36:37.920,0:36:44.240
We looked so hard and searched so 
long to find that. It was so hard

0:36:44.240,0:36:53.200
to come by and now we just ignore 
it. No, don't need that anymore.

0:37:02.400,0:37:22.080
troll cave, which usually means there's 
another troll nearby. Not always.

0:37:35.680,0:37:48.960
I think we're probably going to end up fighting 
these guys. Oh, let's see if we can run by.

0:38:00.000,0:38:12.720
We sailed this whole shoreline at once. There's a 
skelly. Hi there. Must be a burial chamber nearby.

0:38:12.720,0:38:23.680
Blueberries. Uh, we could pick blueberries, 
but And there's Mr. Troll again.

0:38:23.680,0:38:27.440
We're just going to run around 
him. I think we can cut across

0:38:27.440,0:38:42.000
this corner. Uhoh. Bad time to run out of stamina.

0:38:50.480,0:39:02.720
And we're back in the meadows. Perfect. 
And there's probably another bore runstone.

0:39:02.720,0:39:08.800
Looks like it.

0:39:08.800,0:39:10.320
Yep.

0:39:31.760,0:39:37.680
Don't see any buildings over there, but 
I don't think that's what we're looking

0:39:37.680,0:39:46.160
for. I think what we're really wanting 
to find are some abandoned villages.

0:39:46.160,0:39:54.080
And we may end up having to go more inland 
instead of right along the coast. Uh,

0:39:54.080,0:40:05.440
a good deal of the coast may be considered 
not new since we sailed the coastline.

0:40:05.440,0:40:13.680
Don't know. I'm not seeing anything. 
Let's Let's check out this building.

0:40:13.680,0:40:18.800
To me, it looks like an unlikely cuz there's a lot

0:40:18.800,0:40:34.160
of times these don't even 
have a chest in them. Yeah.

0:40:34.160,0:40:43.920
And probably not these structures. I don't 
think I almost never find a chest around those.

0:40:43.920,0:40:51.200
All right. Well, Grine, make up your mind.

0:40:51.200,0:40:55.360
We don't want to mess with you.

0:40:55.360,0:41:01.200
That land looks suspicious.

0:41:01.200,0:41:04.880
Check the map here. It says it's meadows.

0:41:06.720,0:41:11.760
Don't want to run into another uh

0:41:11.760,0:41:16.800
plains area.

0:41:16.800,0:41:22.640
I think we're too close to home for 
the plains. But that island does not

0:41:22.640,0:41:32.800
look normal. It's got a couple of little pine 
trees on it, so it's like half black forest.

0:41:36.800,0:41:42.880
So, when we hit the next section of Black Forest, 
let's double back. And yeah, we don't feel

0:41:42.880,0:42:02.400
rested anymore. There's two rocks. Forgot I was 
looking for rocks. Oh, that looked interesting.

0:42:02.400,0:42:07.920
Maybe.

0:42:07.920,0:42:14.000
Probably not, but maybe.

0:42:14.000,0:42:28.160
I think there's a No. Thought there was going to 
be a beehive back there, but not even a chest.

0:42:33.760,0:42:42.240
That might be a good place 
to hold up for the night.

0:42:42.240,0:42:51.680
Oh, but we found some more mountains. That's nice. 
It's always good to know where those are. Uh oh,

0:42:51.680,0:42:59.840
these mountains are This is our homeland. All 
right. So, here's what I'm thinking. At some

0:42:59.840,0:43:08.960
point, another side quest. Some point 
we can take to those mountains. Also,

0:43:08.960,0:43:19.520
I want to find out what's with this coastline 
here. It doesn't go through. So, it must

0:43:19.520,0:43:25.360
go just like that somewhere. It's somewhere that

0:43:27.920,0:43:37.680
That ocean right here turns into land because 
we never found a way past all of this.

0:43:37.680,0:43:46.320
So, we need to Man, we probably should have 
done that when we were by the Black Forest here.

0:43:46.320,0:43:55.440
We We did this village already, so it 
wouldn't be it. And I'm thinking less likely,

0:43:55.440,0:44:03.680
but this looks good. Anyway, um what 
I'm thinking with the mountains, since

0:44:03.680,0:44:15.680
we're near our homeland and we have mountains, 
maybe we can go up there and tame some wolves.

0:44:15.680,0:44:20.000
Another side quest.

0:44:20.000,0:44:26.960
And then we can use those tame wolves

0:44:26.960,0:44:36.960
uh for pets. It create great great traveling 
companions running through uh the meadows or the

0:44:36.960,0:44:48.800
black forest with the tamed wolf. All right, it's 
night time. Let's uh let's find a good place to

0:44:48.800,0:45:13.280
set up. I kind of like the open area better than 
deep in the woods. Yeah, you guys go back home.

0:45:13.280,0:45:25.280
And I'm a big fan of these oak trees. So, 
let's Oh, shoot. And didn't really want you.

0:45:25.280,0:45:31.600
Let's throw down here. We got a 
gray dwarf coming real quick. Get

0:45:31.600,0:45:42.480
that crafting table down. Crafting table. Come on.

0:45:42.480,0:45:46.400
No, I guess not.

0:45:49.120,0:45:57.600
It's kind of more a nuisance than 
anything. I mean, our armor is,

0:45:57.600,0:46:06.880
you know, we're in the mountains. We're two 
two biomes beyond him. Whatever he dropped,

0:46:06.880,0:46:12.320
I probably don't want it. Puke berries. Nope.

0:46:12.320,0:46:14.800
All right, let's come down here.

0:46:16.560,0:46:24.880
Got some level ground around here. 
This looks good. We can just put

0:46:24.880,0:46:40.480
this right in the middle of anywhere. There we go.

0:46:45.200,0:46:49.840
Sounds like there must be

0:46:49.840,0:47:01.200
skeletons near here. By the way, people 
are butchering the boores nearby.

0:47:01.200,0:47:09.280
All right, let's go by. We're going to give 
this side quest one more day for this episode.

0:47:11.200,0:47:19.920
Maybe two at the most

0:47:19.920,0:47:30.720
and then we'll want to wrap it up. All right, 
we can't put any more board trophies in here

0:47:30.720,0:47:36.640
till we figure out where we have space.

0:47:40.720,0:47:53.760
Not going to put it there. We got 
space, but that's for another thing.

0:47:58.800,0:48:10.960
So, on our to-do list is bring back iron and

0:48:10.960,0:48:17.200
redo the storage area so that it's all iron

0:48:17.200,0:48:35.680
chests, which we could probably even get in 
the same amount space. And yeah, we're full up.

0:48:35.680,0:48:41.600
This is getting ugly.

0:48:41.600,0:48:50.320
So, with the same amount uh boy, 
we got torches coming out our ears.

0:48:57.040,0:49:07.120
leaves us a few spots and all of 
that to find out it's morning. Okay,

0:49:07.120,0:49:16.800
that's the start. We want to go over here 
and pick up the portal. Take it with us.

0:49:23.120,0:49:31.200
and the workbench. All right.

0:49:31.200,0:49:41.040
I'm really curious as to who's killing Bors.

0:49:41.040,0:49:44.160
It's right over here.

0:50:01.520,0:50:13.760
Yep. Skeleton.

0:50:13.760,0:50:17.760
So, why do we have

0:50:17.760,0:50:25.360
skeletons in this area?

0:50:25.360,0:50:43.360
I keep picking up sticks 
and I don't need any wood.

0:50:43.360,0:50:48.000
Same bore. Ruden stone.

0:50:48.000,0:50:52.240
No, this is a new one.

0:50:52.240,0:51:06.400
Give thanks to Frey. Don't interrupt me. Now

0:51:06.400,0:51:10.240
give thanks to Odin.

0:51:15.920,0:51:21.920
Thank you, Odin.

0:51:21.920,0:51:34.640
Going to have to look up who Frey is. I believe I 
believe. I don't know. I would just be guessing.

0:51:38.560,0:51:45.360
So bor meat continues to be used in recipes. 
I think we're still using it in some of our

0:51:45.360,0:51:56.960
recipes. So it's it's really helpful 
to pick that up. And then the scrap uh

0:51:56.960,0:52:03.840
scrap leather that we're picking 
up. That is really handy.

0:52:09.760,0:52:15.040
Uh there's something else.

0:52:15.040,0:52:30.000
Uh later on we're going to make some 
weapons with scrap and we'll go through.

0:52:30.000,0:52:38.640
Sorry, lost my train of thought with 
all these Little guy's pestering me.

0:52:38.640,0:52:47.440
Who broke the tree? We didn't 
do that. That's interesting.

0:52:47.440,0:52:58.880
Maybe a troll came over from the black forest. 
So, we've hit the edge of the black forest.

0:52:58.880,0:53:08.800
Let's just keep uh following its edge. Let's 
get up here where we can see what's around

0:53:08.800,0:53:12.240
or not.

0:53:12.240,0:53:19.520
There we go. Get our stamina back. Getting Let's 
see if we can get to at least two minutes before

0:53:19.520,0:53:30.000
we eat more food. Ah, and here's a house. 
Not what we're looking for, I'm sure, but

0:53:35.040,0:53:42.000
That is a black forest tower, I believe.

0:53:42.000,0:53:52.880
Get a little closer so it comes into 
focus. Yeah, it's a black horse tower.

0:53:57.600,0:54:03.360
That's looks like a great spot for Let's 
go check this out. Just wasting time here,

0:54:03.360,0:54:15.440
but that looks like a great spot for putting 
a home. You got a nice view of the bay.

0:54:15.440,0:54:21.600
Yeah, I thought there you guys 
would be up there somewhere.

0:54:21.600,0:54:29.040
Now we Aren't going to find 
the early axes. What a name,

0:54:29.040,0:54:42.240
early axes. But that's what they gave 
it. We're not going to find those

0:54:42.240,0:54:48.800
in the black forest. So, if we had a treasure 
chest here, I wouldn't expect to see early axes

0:54:48.800,0:54:56.880
in it. And we're not going to find the 
early axe itself. There are two pieces,

0:54:56.880,0:55:04.880
one axe head for each axe. So, it's a set. 
It's a two-handed weapon. Or actually,

0:55:04.880,0:55:18.160
it's two onehanded weapons. So, 
you can't use a shield with it.

0:55:18.160,0:55:22.480
Almost, but not quite.

0:55:22.480,0:55:33.280
No. Go. Nothing there. Seldom I found a

0:55:33.280,0:55:40.800
chest around that kind of structure.

0:55:40.800,0:55:47.120
So, I think what I'll do is follow this 
until I hit nothing but the black forest.

0:55:47.840,0:55:58.720
And then we'll come back and 
scout the base of the mountains.

0:55:58.720,0:56:02.480
That that may be a small black forest. We cuz I

0:56:02.480,0:56:12.320
see big open area up ahead 
of us here for the meadows.

0:56:18.080,0:56:24.080
Okay, we want to come back 
up there and check that out.

0:56:24.080,0:56:28.400
Okay, now it's time to eat.

0:56:28.400,0:56:40.080
Just trying to get the most out of our food 
that we can cuz we've only got one more soup.

0:56:40.080,0:56:43.040
But given where we are and what we're doing,

0:56:43.040,0:57:00.480
we could probably get by with 
eating raspberries again.

0:57:00.480,0:57:06.240
So all this shoreline would 
be considered unexplored,

0:57:06.240,0:57:09.360
but I kind of like, you know, the completeness of

0:57:09.360,0:57:22.560
having it all drawn out. We got 
a Okay, I'll play. Come on back,

0:57:22.560,0:57:28.320
YouTube. You can join the fun.

0:57:36.640,0:57:47.600
Oh, there's something ahead. See? 
I don't think we've been here.

0:57:47.600,0:57:51.120
Not sure that's the structure we're 
looking for. I really think we want

0:57:51.120,0:57:56.640
a village. Yeah, there's not even a chest in here.

0:58:06.800,0:58:15.040
I'm going to head back this way. See if we can 
kind of just fill in this. See the section on

0:58:15.040,0:58:25.440
the mini map. We're filling in the base of 
these mountains. And uh the last of that

0:58:35.280,0:58:45.600
Yeah, we visited the here before. 
Nope, cuz that one has bees.

0:58:45.600,0:58:54.640
And there's a chest in there. Ran by there and 
surprised, but we didn't get stung by the bees.

0:58:55.760,0:59:04.560
I'll take the uh money over a torch. Yeah, we 
don't need a torch, especially the one that's

0:59:04.560,0:59:13.440
partially used. Flint head arrows. We're 
actually low on arrows. That's uh that's

0:59:13.440,0:59:22.880
interesting. We don't need more bore trophies, 
and we probably don't need a skeleton trophy.

0:59:22.880,0:59:27.680
bones.

0:59:27.680,0:59:36.400
Bones come in again much later 
in the game, but when they do,

0:59:36.400,0:59:42.960
there's also an ample source of bones around. 
So, I don't know if if we're going to need

0:59:42.960,1:00:03.440
bones. Okay, that's the water. That's the 
mountains. We've been there. There we go.

1:00:16.080,1:00:20.080
This

1:00:20.080,1:00:29.280
cold's really been sticking on 
forever. Way too long. It's not normal.

1:00:31.920,1:00:36.720
This is another new building

1:00:36.720,1:00:41.440
right on the edge of the black forest,

1:00:41.440,1:00:51.200
but not what we're looking for. Oh, chest.

1:00:51.200,1:00:56.240
All right. Um,

1:00:56.240,1:00:58.640
so over here we have black forest.

1:01:01.600,1:01:09.120
carrot seeds. Let's just go ahead and

1:01:09.120,1:01:22.080
try to fill out this missing area 
as we head towards the coastline.

1:01:22.080,1:01:32.320
Well, one thing about this quest, we're 
going to end up with a lot of borate.

1:01:32.320,1:01:36.240
Now, we might miss

1:01:36.240,1:01:51.600
a building or two in this search, but what I 
think we're looking for is a whole village. So,

1:01:51.600,1:01:57.040
all right. Maybe I should have got my weapon out.

1:01:57.040,1:02:09.440
Works a little better that way. All 
right. Which way are we going? This way.

1:02:09.440,1:02:11.600
All right. So, we'll skip that ravine.

1:02:25.040,1:02:39.520
And let's just run through the black forest. 
Hopefully we get through it before nighttime.

1:02:39.520,1:02:44.560
Wow. Oh, is that No, it's not.

1:02:44.560,1:02:58.080
Got a lot of friends there, don't we?

1:02:58.080,1:03:06.960
I think we're going to end up sailing 
to a nearby island to find more

1:03:06.960,1:03:08.320
meadows.

1:03:10.320,1:03:20.080
But we still got a pretty big chunk of land 
on this continent that we have not explored.

1:03:20.080,1:03:27.360
Oh, we need those.

1:03:27.360,1:03:32.800
Might as well make use of 
the fact that we're here.

1:03:32.800,1:03:37.760
And that's a good little

1:03:37.760,1:03:51.680
section. Whatever. Berry bunch. 
It's a very very good bunch.

1:03:51.680,1:03:55.600
More cover.

1:03:55.600,1:04:00.160
More trolls.

1:04:00.160,1:04:11.280
How much longer we get on our ether? 
52 seconds. And we don't feel rested.

1:04:11.280,1:04:21.360
We're leaving the bear behind. And 
the troll didn't follow us. So,

1:04:21.360,1:04:26.960
I think our ether is going to last long enough.

1:04:26.960,1:04:28.880
And there's another bear.

1:04:45.920,1:04:55.840
Stamina comes back very slowly when 
you don't have that rested buff.

1:04:55.840,1:04:57.840
Another copper deposit.

1:05:01.600,1:05:06.400
More blueberries.

1:05:06.400,1:05:08.400
Well, we're getting something out of this quest,

1:05:08.400,1:05:19.120
even if we're not finding early 
axes. Skeleton noticed us.

1:05:19.120,1:05:25.760
We're out of ether and we're back in the meadows.

1:05:25.760,1:05:36.640
That's perfect. Okay.

1:05:36.640,1:05:49.680
Do we like a board trophy? We 
don't want any board trophies.

1:05:49.680,1:06:02.720
Is there going to be an opening up here 
somewhere? Yes, that's where we're going to stop.

1:06:02.720,1:06:11.840
Let's use all the daylight we can.

1:06:18.880,1:06:32.160
Oh, even if we don't eat the neck meat, that 
uh would become a good food source for our

1:06:32.160,1:06:38.320
wolf cubs.

1:06:38.320,1:06:51.040
if we decide to start raising wolves. 
The nice thing about having uh unlike the

1:06:51.040,1:06:55.200
All right,

1:06:55.200,1:06:58.960
we're going to stop right here. Oh,

1:06:58.960,1:07:05.760
there's a building. Guess we got to 
check out the building, don't we?

1:07:08.080,1:07:15.600
And then we'll just put our 
As long as there's not a

1:07:15.600,1:07:24.320
Oh, it's one of those not 
worth checking out buildings.

1:07:24.320,1:07:28.720
And I was going to say as long 
as it's not what forgot what

1:07:28.720,1:07:34.320
I was saying. Start thinking 
about setting up this portal.

1:07:38.560,1:07:41.520
I like that little stone structure there we're

1:07:41.520,1:07:52.080
putting the portal up next to. Don't 
ask me why. Just uh something I like.

1:07:52.080,1:08:02.080
Okay, let's give it one more day before we uh

1:08:02.080,1:08:03.440
wrap this one up.

1:08:05.920,1:08:10.720
Not going to

1:08:10.720,1:08:16.480
worry too much about it. It's going 
to take a while. And this is just a

1:08:16.480,1:08:32.880
side quest that we're after. That won't 
work until we put down a crafting table.

1:08:39.680,1:08:46.640
All right, here we go.

1:08:46.640,1:09:00.160
Forgot where I was or what I was saying.

1:09:00.160,1:09:02.240
All right, let's uh get some sleep.

1:09:38.000,1:09:42.400
Sorry about the interruption.

1:09:42.400,1:09:48.720
Oh, that's I thought something hit that and it 
just does sparkles when we drag across it. Okay,

1:09:48.720,1:10:00.960
Grandma was telling me that it's time for bed, but 
I'd really like to spend one more day before we

1:10:00.960,1:10:08.640
call this one a done deal.

1:10:08.640,1:10:13.440
And we maxed out our bones.

1:10:13.440,1:10:16.320
Guess we can use this for overflow.

1:10:20.000,1:10:25.200
Uh, but we renewed some of our I think we more

1:10:25.200,1:10:34.480
than doubled the amount of berries 
we had. And we don't need arrows.

1:10:34.480,1:10:41.360
Well, we do need arrows. Let's just carry them.

1:10:48.080,1:11:02.240
Got a lot of housekeeping we need to do. 
We got to get that iron and bring it back.

1:11:02.240,1:11:03.920
That way if we run into a troll,

1:11:03.920,1:11:09.840
we've got 64 arrows. But the iron, 
we got to bring the iron back for

1:11:11.600,1:11:18.880
improving the storage. And then 
we're going to have to finish up the

1:11:18.880,1:11:23.280
west shore farm

1:11:23.280,1:11:27.600
and

1:11:27.600,1:11:31.600
get that silver down out of the 
mountain and start mining it.

1:11:32.480,1:11:42.480
Um, so my plans are that going forward I'm 
going to use these live streams that I just

1:11:42.480,1:11:52.400
get a hankering for playing and we go do some 
side quest and then the normal quests are going

1:11:52.400,1:12:06.240
to be trying to wrap up the biome. So like getting 
the silver down and finding the motor and finding

1:12:06.240,1:12:14.480
all that kind of stuff. Did we find 
motor? Yeah. So that much is done.

1:12:14.480,1:12:21.760
Mowing is right by the howling cavern. 
So the howling cavern is a fun little

1:12:21.760,1:12:27.920
uh special dungeon. That's one of Hild 
deer's quests along with the smoldering

1:12:27.920,1:12:38.320
tomb. Didn't we see the smoldering tomb? Yeah, 
we even got a portal next to it. Smolder. So,

1:12:38.320,1:12:46.240
I think once we have the silver 
armor, I'll do the smoldering tomb.

1:12:46.240,1:12:53.920
Um, don't I'd like to have fire resistant 
potion by then. I don't think we have those yet,

1:12:53.920,1:13:08.320
do we? Anyway, let's take a look at where we are 
right now. We Wow. So, we mapped that little area.

1:13:08.320,1:13:18.080
It seems like we're Okay, that's that's because 
this is all all of this is mountains and that was

1:13:18.080,1:13:23.120
black forest. So, let's go back here and 
follow this edge of the black forest. We

1:13:23.120,1:13:28.640
should probably run into more mountains and then 
we'll follow it around and hopefully circle back

1:13:28.640,1:13:42.880
to the shore and fill in some of this meadows 
area. So, heading back to the Black Forest,

1:13:42.880,1:13:47.440
we've got six minutes before 
we can use Ether again.

1:13:49.360,1:14:04.800
I assume we check that building 
out, but I don't remember seeing it.

1:14:04.800,1:14:16.000
It's got bees, but no chest. So, no, this is a 
new new building. We haven't been here before.

1:14:17.360,1:14:29.520
We're going to Am I? Yeah, I'm going the right 
direction. Heading back to that black forest.

1:14:29.520,1:14:42.080
That's the shoreline.

1:14:42.080,1:14:57.920
So, here we go. Got some skeleton friends. I 
guess we might as well uh steal their treasure

1:14:57.920,1:15:11.280
or not. Uh where's Oh, here's 
the stairs. Okay. Yeah, we

1:15:11.280,1:15:19.200
It's usually on the top floor. if there is any.

1:15:19.200,1:15:27.360
And doesn't look like there is nothing here.

1:15:27.360,1:15:37.120
Nothing there. All right.

1:15:43.600,1:15:52.720
clean up our mess. I hate leaving stuff lying 
around. This isn't our mess. This is the uh Yeah,

1:15:52.720,1:16:03.440
we don't have room. Looks like the rain 
might be stopping. That'd be nice. Um,

1:16:03.440,1:16:20.080
got our portal. Don't need that. Don't 
need that. We'll grab this deer stuff.

1:16:20.080,1:16:27.920
And we want to be out of the 
black forest in the meadows.

1:16:27.920,1:16:32.320
Getting hard to get around.

1:16:35.520,1:16:45.120
Might as well keep up the board collection.

1:16:45.120,1:16:54.480
Now we got to make room for bore mate. We 
haven't been using or collecting enough

1:16:54.480,1:17:01.280
stones to even think about using them 
for a fire. So, we'll get rid of them.

1:17:03.520,1:17:17.680
I mean, ideally what we would do is we'd drop 
a fire right now. Get rid of our wet debuff.

1:17:17.680,1:17:29.360
This is going to be a bigger area than I thought.

1:17:29.360,1:17:39.120
It's nice that uh maybe incorrectly, but we walk 
through here with impunity. We're not worried

1:17:39.120,1:17:52.320
about any of the creatures that are going to come 
up on us. A bear, a troll, anything like that.

1:17:52.320,1:17:56.160
Have we?

1:17:56.160,1:18:01.920
We haven't been here. Okay, this is 
this is unexpected. Let me check out

1:18:01.920,1:18:13.200
this map. What do we see in here? 
Come on, guys. I got places to be.

1:18:13.200,1:18:22.880
So, this must be this ocean. I 
was wondering where that was.

1:18:22.880,1:18:31.040
So, kind of tempting to run this way 
and follow how far that ocean. So,

1:18:31.040,1:18:42.560
we know over here we've got ocean shore and just 
that little bitty bit of land that connected. So,

1:18:42.560,1:18:51.520
I'm guessing this is going to come 
around here to connect to there.

1:18:51.520,1:19:00.480
And that's probably what we want to do. Even 
though that's black forest. I want to see I

1:19:00.480,1:19:07.360
want to see what this land looks like. But 
we're looking we're looking for meadows. So

1:19:07.360,1:19:17.040
uh nah. Let's stay in the meadows. Let's 
uh we'll follow the shoreline this way.

1:19:17.040,1:19:45.760
Okay. I will fill this secret 
in eventually, but not today.

1:19:45.760,1:19:48.320
Got a little building over there.

1:19:51.920,1:20:07.760
We kind of covered this area, 
didn't we? Pretty close.

1:20:07.760,1:20:13.840
All right, let's see what this building's got.

1:20:22.880,1:20:26.880
It's got a beehive.

1:20:26.880,1:20:34.880
Can we take the beehive down from here? Yes.

1:20:34.880,1:20:39.280
Let's get rid of some of these.

1:20:42.320,1:20:50.880
Well, that was too easy.

1:20:50.880,1:21:03.680
Is there a chest up there? Yes. And that is 
exactly what we are been looking for. That's the

1:21:03.680,1:21:11.840
first piece, the curious axe head. So, after that, 
we've got to find another one, and we'll just give

1:21:11.840,1:21:24.640
them a torch. All right, new material. Curious 
axe head. Fantastic. Not a total loss. All right,

1:21:24.640,1:21:34.560
let's eat some food and then as long as we're 
knocked it down. I hate to just leave it here.

1:21:37.760,1:21:49.440
Okay, so we know that this type of structure 
holds a curious axe head. Don't know if it's

1:21:49.440,1:21:58.400
the only one that does or if it holds the also 
holds the other one. We are also out of food,

1:21:58.400,1:22:10.960
so we need a stamina of food to fill that 
slot. But right now, we're going to do a

1:22:10.960,1:22:29.920
crafting table just so we can go in here and tear 
down that shelf and grab the honey and the bee.

1:22:29.920,1:22:33.200
A disadvantage to that. Let's put the chest back.

1:22:38.640,1:22:46.240
Can't put it up there, but we can put it here.

1:22:46.240,1:22:54.400
Can't pick up that. We did get the honey.

1:22:54.400,1:23:02.400
We don't need the ch uh to Yeah, there's our bee. 
We don't need a trophy. We don't need a torch.

1:23:03.040,1:23:10.880
Don't need a torch. Okay.

1:23:10.880,1:23:18.400
Well, I'm excited.

1:23:18.400,1:23:28.160
We didn't even have to leave 
our homeland continent.

1:23:28.160,1:23:35.280
All right, we've got Ether 
back. Let's uh make use of it.

1:23:35.280,1:23:48.880
Got any more buildings.

1:23:48.880,1:23:55.760
Something up there, but I almost 
think we saw that already.

1:24:02.480,1:24:21.200
Didn't we? It looks just like the one 
we visited before, but I guess it's not.

1:24:26.960,1:24:39.520
There's no chest up there, so 
no need to go higher. All right.

1:24:47.600,1:25:00.640
So, this area didn't get filled in, but 
I don't think there's anything there.

1:25:00.640,1:25:08.800
Got a runstone. I think we've seen most. Oh, this 
one looks a little different. The shield wall.

1:25:13.280,1:25:24.800
chosen by the all father himself.

1:25:24.800,1:25:37.360
Skeletons

1:25:49.840,1:25:58.400
Ah, very encouraging message for Conrad.

1:25:58.400,1:26:03.200
Where'd those two go?

1:26:09.040,1:26:18.240
There's one of them.

1:26:18.240,1:26:32.080
I don't know. We don't care. We 
just want to fill in this gap.

1:26:36.080,1:26:46.960
Okay. So, from here on, we got Black Forest.

1:26:49.680,1:26:55.520
We want to go back here and 
fill this part of the map in,

1:26:55.520,1:27:15.360
which I think we covered pretty well, but 
there's a hole in the map, so it's bugging me.

1:27:17.040,1:27:20.800
All right.

1:27:20.800,1:27:27.680
Where to next? The next spot

1:27:27.680,1:27:37.600
would be to follow that around. 
I think we're almost out of time.

1:27:37.600,1:27:42.400
Over here we got What's this? 
This is planes, isn't it?

1:27:44.080,1:27:50.400
And then there's some swamp over here. I'll be

1:27:50.400,1:27:56.160
Must be a pretty big ocean right here.

1:27:56.160,1:28:05.040
Which is interesting that you get this 
uh inland sea, I guess, because it's all

1:28:05.040,1:28:11.520
surrounded by land. Like this is a tiny one, 
but this is going to be a much bigger one.

1:28:16.960,1:28:28.640
Let's look at Yeah, let's look at closing this 
out. Find out the extent of our mountains here

1:28:28.640,1:28:33.520
and how we can bring Oh, it it's 
night time. I guess we're going to

1:28:33.520,1:28:40.240
wrap it up. Let's just get somewhere 
safe. Uh let's head to the shore.

1:28:43.840,1:29:05.120
See if we can drag a boar or two with us.

1:29:05.120,1:29:08.080
Where'd that other one go?

1:29:18.720,1:29:32.320
leather scraps. Thought we were carrying 
leather scraps with us. Instead, we got a

1:29:32.320,1:29:35.200
All right.

1:29:47.440,1:29:54.560
So, just take a moment to 
take in that glorious sunset.

1:29:54.560,1:29:59.200
Wish I had my fishing pole.

1:30:02.400,1:30:08.640
Well, we're halfway there.

1:30:08.640,1:30:22.640
We've got the first of two.

1:30:22.640,1:30:26.480
Invalid placement.

1:30:26.480,1:30:28.640
Guess we were too close to something.

1:30:33.280,1:30:43.120
I think uh I think we'll look at wrapping up here.

1:30:43.120,1:30:49.680
So,

1:30:49.680,1:30:56.400
I'm Grandpa. We're playing Valheim. I really 
appreate app appreciate you joining us for uh

1:30:56.400,1:31:04.880
Conrad's adventure through the 10th world. 
Next time uh we'll continue our side quest

1:31:04.880,1:31:13.840
and see if we can't find the other half of the 
early axes. Until then, you all have a good one.
