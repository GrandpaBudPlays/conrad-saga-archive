## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:06.080,0:00:11.760
Welcome back. I'm Grandpa and 
we're playing Valheim. Today,

0:00:11.760,0:00:18.400
we're going to continue the search for the 
early access. So, without that, I guess it's

0:00:18.400,0:00:28.240
time to get a little sleep and make sure we've 
got everything we need for the return trip.

0:00:28.240,0:00:40.720
clear out our inventory, try not to rush out 
without our raincoat, and see what happens.

0:00:40.720,0:00:55.600
Looks like we've got some stuff 
to get rid of. Little treasure.

0:00:55.600,0:01:00.000
Running out of room for these arrows

0:01:00.000,0:01:19.360
about gone.

0:01:41.760,0:01:46.560
really running out of room here. This 
is crazy. Going to have to bring that

0:01:46.560,0:01:58.080
iron over and get started on the Maybe we'll 
maybe we'll just do a separate episode and

0:02:02.160,0:02:24.480
add in the storage room that I'm so fond of.

0:02:40.880,0:02:46.160
So, here's the first accent, the 
curious. And I think the second

0:02:46.160,0:02:53.840
one's called the mysterious or something 
like that. So, we'll have to find that

0:02:53.840,0:03:02.400
hopefully on this goround.

0:03:02.400,0:03:14.000
All right, let's um see what we've got 
going with these. Wow, I forgot how slow.

0:03:14.000,0:03:28.320
So, that's the start. Did I change that? 
No. Okay. And that is our traveling portal.

0:03:28.320,0:03:49.360
And this should be right where we 
left off. So which way from here?

0:03:49.360,0:03:55.440
I'm curious to know about this inland sea. 
I think I'm going to take it this way and

0:03:55.440,0:04:01.680
see if we can close off this arc of this 
area over here. Sure. There's plenty of

0:04:01.680,0:04:08.160
land there that we haven't looked at yet. 
Uh so if we can see the extent of that,

0:04:08.160,0:04:12.960
I'm guessing it's going to be right in here 
somewhere. But if we can see the extent of that

0:04:12.960,0:04:20.080
land, we'll know what to cover for what's 
missing. So let's follow the black forest

0:04:20.080,0:04:29.440
uh and head that way. Okay. But first, 
let's pick up our portal and workbench.

0:04:33.920,0:04:49.120
And I think if we just head straight 
that way, we're going to be there.

0:04:49.120,0:04:56.240
And I I know I've said this a few times. Oh, 
we got I don't I just don't know what we're

0:04:56.240,0:05:12.320
going to do with more bees. seems a waste to 
try to gather them up since we can't use them.

0:05:12.320,0:05:34.320
They would just take up 
space back at the home base.

0:06:00.640,0:06:09.840
started playing Enshrouded yesterday for the 
first time. Um, it's interesting to see. Okay,

0:06:09.840,0:06:16.240
that's a really small little sliver 
of Black Forest, it looks like. Let's,

0:06:16.240,0:06:22.240
uh, let's go ahead and follow it.

0:06:22.240,0:06:28.560
Uh, must have a, uh,

0:06:28.560,0:06:33.360
yeah.

0:06:33.360,0:06:40.240
I don't know if we mark this or if we need 
it, but it never hurts to mark these burial

0:06:40.240,0:06:53.360
chambers. Bur burial chambers. I'm having 
trouble talking today. That's nothing new.

0:06:53.360,0:07:00.400
But it never hurts to mark those so that 
we can come back to them at some point.

0:07:15.520,0:07:24.560
Okay, there's a little more black 
forest here than I first thought.

0:07:40.400,0:07:47.680
I'm guessing that slope transitions 
into mountains somewhere.

0:07:47.680,0:07:56.640
And this looks like we're transitioning back into 
the meadows, which is perfect for our search. So,

0:07:56.640,0:08:06.080
let's go ahead stick to the edge of the 
black forest and uh keep an eye out for

0:08:06.080,0:08:16.880
uh any of those abandoned buildings that we're 
looking for. So, we found the um the last one

0:08:16.880,0:08:29.760
in a tower, I believe. So, that means that 
this one we're going to find is in an A-frame.

0:08:29.760,0:08:38.160
And in my adventures, Grandpa's adventures, 
not Conrad's grandpa's adventures with Iris,

0:08:38.160,0:08:52.640
we found the other axe head. And so 
we were we found it in the A-frame.

0:08:52.640,0:08:55.120
Not going to be anything in here that we need,

0:08:55.120,0:09:04.160
but it's always hard for me to pass 
up a chance at a little treasure,

0:09:04.160,0:09:09.920
even though we really can't use 
much of it. Oh, and there's a troll.

0:09:15.600,0:09:21.520
God on it. Got up there and then

0:09:21.520,0:09:31.040
I want to get out of the tower before he starts 
tearing it down. But we'll take this uh and

0:09:31.040,0:09:44.160
then we'll go see. Is he carrying a tree trunk 
with him or No, looks like he's empty-handed.

0:09:44.160,0:09:49.840
So, if we're careful, this 
shouldn't be too bad a fight.

0:09:49.840,0:09:58.800
That wasn't careful. That 
should have been a dodge.

0:10:16.720,0:10:26.400
And there we go. Those fights are getting 
easier. And they should be. I mean,

0:10:29.200,0:10:48.400
We're a full one tier away 
from him being a challenge. So,

0:10:48.400,0:10:51.680
all right, we got a bunch of stuff 
in inventory from that that we don't

0:10:51.680,0:10:55.680
need. We can dump it later. Let's keep moving.

0:10:59.520,0:11:08.960
Need to find that just the perfect A-frame. 
Thought I saw one right there, but maybe it was

0:11:08.960,0:11:21.520
just that rock and the way that tree branch was 
laying. Got another beehive. Yet another beehive.

0:11:21.520,0:11:24.800
And we found

0:11:27.280,0:11:31.440
uh the edge of the mountains,

0:11:31.440,0:11:34.000
which I think at some point we're going to come

0:11:34.000,0:11:43.040
back here and try to do some 
wolf taming so that we can

0:11:43.040,0:11:49.600
have wolves back at the home base.

0:12:10.880,0:12:18.480
Just scouting out the edge of these meadows. 
Make sure we have our bases covered in finding

0:12:18.480,0:12:38.640
any possible abandoned buildings and 
also finding the extent of the mountains.

0:12:38.640,0:12:44.320
Very small chance we might run into a 
wolf down here, but it's pretty unlikely.

0:12:45.440,0:12:58.000
We'd have to make a lot of noise 
to get him to come down this far.

0:12:58.000,0:13:05.760
Okay, we've completed the the circle 
here if we look at the big map.

0:13:07.200,0:13:14.560
So, at this point, I want to start skirting 
this edge and clear out that first section

0:13:14.560,0:13:23.200
of un identified meadows. And then we'll 
double back this way. Work our way back

0:13:23.200,0:13:33.520
and forth until we've feel like we've got 
proper crisscross search of the meadows.

0:13:36.240,0:13:44.880
So, watching the mini map, you 
see the meadows start to break

0:13:44.880,0:13:51.920
the fog of war away

0:13:51.920,0:13:58.400
as we search for buildings.

0:14:25.120,0:14:35.920
hard to walk by some of those. um mushrooms 
and raspberries and not pick them up. But

0:14:35.920,0:14:53.280
I don't want to waste a lot of 
time gathering resources right now.

0:15:09.200,0:15:14.800
Okay,

0:15:14.800,0:15:19.360
let's head this way.

0:15:23.600,0:15:36.560
That isn't the right kind of building. It's 
really unlikely that we're going to find it there.

0:15:36.560,0:15:40.240
So, we'll head this way and kind of just close off

0:15:40.240,0:15:48.640
that and continue right after we get 
a bite to eat. Oh, we did it again.

0:15:48.640,0:16:00.320
We needed some food and we didn't grab any 
uh we need to make soup and we didn't do it.

0:16:00.320,0:16:03.920
Now we can throw down at any 
point we can throw down a

0:16:03.920,0:16:15.040
uh portal and jump back. So it's 
not a big deal. Just my usual

0:16:15.040,0:16:19.920
carelessness and wanting to 
hurry and get started. Now,

0:16:19.920,0:16:28.960
here's an A-frame that I don't 
think we've been in. We got a

0:16:28.960,0:16:32.720
We got a beehive in the front there,

0:16:32.720,0:16:40.080
which I'm just going to run past 
and we'll probably get stung.

0:16:40.080,0:16:44.800
But we got the uh

0:16:44.800,0:16:49.200
health to take it on the chin.

0:16:49.200,0:16:57.760
I'm going to leave in my skeleton trophy. 
I don't think we're going to need it.

0:16:57.760,0:17:11.440
And I could leave him, but there we 
go. That's the poison that we expected.

0:17:18.560,0:17:39.440
Just closing off that section of the 
map and then we'll head back this way.

0:17:46.640,0:17:53.040
I don't know. Possibly I should 
make the grid search tighter,

0:17:53.040,0:18:08.160
but I hope we're covering it properly.

0:18:08.160,0:18:17.120
Now we're getting to where 
we need that rested buff.

0:18:17.120,0:18:24.400
Not a lot of danger where we are and not 
a lot of experience points coming. So the

0:18:24.400,0:18:35.200
rested buff doesn't add or subtract 
that much. We should be relatively

0:18:35.200,0:18:47.200
safe in this zone given our current food that 
we're eating and armor that we're wearing.

0:18:47.200,0:18:54.160
Just shouldn't be much of a problem.

0:19:04.400,0:19:10.240
All right, looks like the sun's going 
to set on us. Let's go ahead and This a

0:19:10.240,0:19:33.280
good spot as any to pitch our portal and head 
out right after we deal with the Mr. railing.

0:19:33.280,0:19:42.640
All right, let's do it.

0:19:42.640,0:19:48.640
Anyway, playing in Shrouded 
is kind of interesting. Um,

0:19:48.640,0:19:55.680
it's very similar game to Valheim.

0:19:55.680,0:20:09.360
I haven't uh got over the learning curve 
yet enough to fall in love with it.

0:20:09.360,0:20:15.360
So, I'll reserve judgment 
and we'll see where it goes.

0:21:52.640,0:22:02.720
Not what I want to do, but I'm running out 
of choices. Okay, we want to make some soup.

0:22:05.280,0:22:15.120
Look at the turnups. Can we make a turnup 
stew? No, that's not. Yeah, that's stamina.

0:22:15.120,0:22:26.480
Yeah. And we want to get rid of some of this 
meat, too. So, that'll serve two purposes.

0:22:48.960,0:23:05.680
the turnups.

0:23:40.960,0:23:49.200
Well, that certainly got rid of turnipss.

0:23:57.840,0:24:18.320
That spice rack gets in the way so often.

0:24:27.440,0:24:44.000
Going to let this video go till uh the end of 
this day and then we'll look at wrapping it up.

0:25:01.360,0:25:08.960
Nope. Got to pick up that portal. 
I almost walked off and left it.

0:25:12.880,0:25:16.400
Let's make sure we can still recreate it. There's

0:25:16.400,0:25:37.920
our table. There's our portal. Both look 
like we're good. Now we can head out.

0:25:42.560,0:26:07.280
Kind of surprised there's usually more abandoned 
buildings when we have a big clearing like this.

0:26:19.280,0:26:35.120
Little slow on the draw there.

0:27:34.800,0:27:39.840
Boy, I really would like to find the vendor.

0:27:39.840,0:27:50.560
There's so many things. I want 
my fishing pole for one. I just

0:27:50.560,0:27:55.840
want to spend some time standing 
out in the meadows and relaxing.

0:28:00.640,0:28:23.600
We got a little pond here.

0:28:37.440,0:28:45.120
Okay, there's the black forest. And I think that's 
the buildings we've been missing. I thought that

0:28:45.120,0:28:52.400
there should been some close to that clearing. 
And it looks like we got a couple right there.

0:28:56.080,0:29:05.520
Let's fill in this gap real quick. 
Just want to make sure I don't miss

0:29:05.520,0:29:16.000
cuz as sure as I miss a building, it'll be 
the one with the mysterious axe head in it.

0:29:20.560,0:29:36.240
This looks promising, but looks can be deceiving.

0:29:36.240,0:29:51.840
And there's yet another one down there. No chest. 
So, I think we're out of luck on on this one.

0:29:51.840,0:30:04.480
There's our chest. No axe head. Oh, darn 
it. I was really hopeful that was it. Let's

0:30:04.480,0:30:09.520
uh let's head up on onto this empty

0:30:18.480,0:30:24.960
Just a skeleton of an A-frame.

0:30:24.960,0:30:33.520
Nope. Still no luck.

0:30:33.520,0:30:40.880
All right, let's fill in these 
gaps. Make sure we're Getting

0:30:40.880,0:30:48.800
this covered. Not hunting 
deer today, you lucky boy.

0:30:48.800,0:31:05.360
Girl, whatever.

0:31:07.360,0:31:29.280
Not really hunting boore either, but they're 
aggressive, so might as well get the jump on them.

0:31:41.040,0:31:51.440
So, just watching the mini map, trying to fill in 
the blank areas while I'm looking for buildings.

0:31:51.440,0:31:56.240
That's not an A-frame.

0:31:56.240,0:31:59.440
So, it's pretty unlikely because I I have

0:31:59.440,0:32:07.760
heard rumor that what we're 
looking for is in an A-frame.

0:32:07.760,0:32:14.240
Dude, I think we caught that building last time.

0:32:15.600,0:32:26.160
Part of the problem Iris and I ran into also 
is we weren't marking the buildings as we went.

0:32:26.160,0:32:32.800
Yeah, that's the one I got stung in last time.

0:32:32.800,0:32:42.240
Let's do Let's start doing that. We'll mark 
this as completed. I'm just going to give it a

0:32:47.280,0:32:53.440
one of those. I would love more more

0:32:53.440,0:33:12.000
icons for the map. If the if I could make 
a suggestion to the devs, that would be it.

0:33:12.000,0:33:23.040
Maybe I should drop by their Discord channel 
and throw that in the suggestion box.

0:33:31.120,0:33:36.560
So there's the black forest.

0:33:36.560,0:33:43.280
So we've kind of covered 
this section as much as we

0:33:43.280,0:33:49.680
need to for this purpose.

0:35:06.000,0:35:26.320
My maps tend to get way too cluttered with stuff.

0:35:47.440,0:36:02.560
Look like we got some gray 
dwarfs waiting for us up here.

0:36:12.560,0:36:17.680
Thought I heard a skeleton, but I guess not.

0:36:17.680,0:36:26.160
All right, we'll follow this a little ways.

0:36:41.840,0:36:47.360
So let's take uh

0:36:47.360,0:36:54.560
I guess this path towards the water.

0:36:54.560,0:37:07.760
Closer than I expected.

0:37:07.760,0:37:18.160
The

0:37:18.160,0:37:22.240
shoreline's getting pretty broken up here.

0:37:26.240,0:37:30.480
that got a storm coming in.

0:37:30.480,0:37:40.080
Looks like it.

0:37:40.080,0:37:48.880
Let's outline this coastline a little bit.

0:37:48.880,0:37:51.120
Going to go ahead and get wet.

0:37:56.080,0:38:02.080
Oh, should have checked my stamina first.

0:38:02.080,0:38:11.360
No need to injure yourself over it.

0:38:11.360,0:38:15.200
There we go.

0:38:18.560,0:38:42.080
Oh, we're going to have a few uh bores right 
here. They're kind of all trapped in this area.

0:39:07.840,0:39:11.280
Well, that should do it for this section.

0:39:31.360,0:39:38.880
Yeah, we're running out of time for 
this uh episode search, it looks like.

0:39:38.880,0:39:46.640
Let's uh swim across here

0:39:46.640,0:40:11.280
or walk and we'll just outline this 
uh little pond, lake, inlet. What?

0:40:11.280,0:40:15.760
Well, that's not what I was expecting.

0:40:16.960,0:40:22.000
All right, we've got this whole

0:40:22.000,0:40:27.120
island thing going here.

0:40:27.120,0:40:36.400
Wow, this is interesting.

0:40:36.400,0:40:43.280
Right now, I'm just trying to be complete on 
my map because there's no buildings out here.

0:40:49.120,0:41:04.720
Nice deer if we were deer hunting.

0:41:23.520,0:41:32.160
Yeah, we went we went out there 
already, right? No, we didn't.

0:41:32.160,0:41:39.520
More bores. We're getting plenty of bore meat.

0:41:39.520,0:41:45.760
Poor

0:41:45.760,0:41:49.680
stamina planning.

0:41:49.680,0:42:00.160
Need to eat food. That's the problem.

0:42:08.960,0:42:16.960
Let's see what the lore says.

0:42:16.960,0:42:24.400
This land is hard and wild, but we who are brought 
here are harder still. Take comfort, traveler,

0:42:24.400,0:42:32.320
in the gifts before you, the good wood and stone, 
the fruits and flowers of the forest. Look also to

0:42:32.320,0:42:40.400
the wild boar who roam these lands. They fear fire 
and the hand of man, but they can be taught to

0:42:40.400,0:42:49.280
obey. Go quietly to them and let them eat of your 
stock. Roots of the ground are their pleasure.

0:42:50.160,0:43:00.800
So that's kind of the clues about how we can tame 
bores and we can also grow them and use them for

0:43:00.800,0:43:17.280
cooking and etc. Okay, I really feel like I'm 
losing track of where we are or where I am cuz

0:43:17.280,0:43:26.720
that stretch of land doesn't appear to be on my 
map. But I thought we were over there already.

0:43:26.720,0:43:34.160
But it's getting dark. I'm gonna try 
to check out this peninsula and then

0:43:34.160,0:43:44.000
we're going to have to call it for this episode.

0:43:44.000,0:43:47.600
Would be really great just to have 
a building out here in the middle

0:43:47.600,0:43:57.440
of nowhere and wrap up our search 
for the axes. But even at that,

0:43:57.440,0:44:15.040
I kind of want to not want to 
know what's all on my homeland.

0:44:15.040,0:44:19.840
Got a neck chasing me.

0:44:21.920,0:44:29.520
I don't have any use for the net meat right now.

0:44:29.520,0:44:39.920
Yeah, this is all uncharted but no buildings

0:44:39.920,0:44:48.720
so far.

0:44:48.720,0:44:54.480
I believe that a certain point

0:44:54.480,0:45:05.120
in the game, well, as you go, like like you have 
noticed, we'll we'll see grey dwarfs at night,

0:45:05.120,0:45:16.720
but I think there's other creatures now that we've 
killed Bone Mass. We could see Drewar at night.

0:45:16.720,0:45:21.280
Um,

0:45:21.280,0:45:29.840
and I think once we kill motor,

0:45:29.840,0:45:33.360
is that a That's just trees.

0:45:34.240,0:45:46.080
Once we kill motor, we'll be able to 
start seeing mountain creatures at night.

0:45:46.080,0:45:59.040
Right now, I think we got some skeletons.

0:45:59.040,0:46:10.160
And I think we're gonna have to uh head home 
as soon as we turn the corner right here.

0:46:10.160,0:46:21.520
Lots of skeletons.

0:46:21.520,0:46:25.600
I'm fairly sure that during the 
daytime we wouldn't see these out here.

0:46:26.160,0:46:29.520
They're only here because we're wandering around

0:46:29.520,0:46:39.680
in the middle of the night when we 
should have packed up and headed home.

0:46:39.680,0:46:48.640
But if those skeletons are the 
worst Oh, I'm not eating food.

0:46:48.640,0:46:54.640
If those skeletons are the worst, I'm not 
very concerned. And there's some black forest.

0:46:55.840,0:47:03.760
Not going to head that any further that 
way. Where are we on the big map? Ah,

0:47:03.760,0:47:15.760
we are We've actually Oh, that's 
interesting. It looks like there's a

0:47:15.760,0:47:19.680
Yeah. Well, I thought this 
was a peninsula, and it is.

0:47:20.240,0:47:27.200
I think we're going to just cut back right here 
and fill that in. But we might be tying into that

0:47:27.200,0:47:36.240
black forest right there. I don't know. Uh we'll 
find out more next time. Right now, it's time to

0:47:36.240,0:47:45.360
uh read this runstone and then head home. On 
this spot, a tree fell on my head and I cursed

0:47:45.360,0:47:55.200
the gods. So, I leave this stone in praise of 
them that they might forgive my reckless words.

0:47:55.200,0:48:08.720
There we go. We were lucky. We did not have a 
u a tree kill us. We did manage to jump in the

0:48:08.720,0:48:15.360
moat we were digging and kill ourselves. That's 
almost as good as having a tree fall on you.

0:48:23.120,0:48:31.360
Got some company before we 
leave home. Leave for home.

0:48:31.360,0:48:39.360
All right, I think we can head out.

0:48:52.640,0:48:58.880
Got lots of bore meat.

0:48:58.880,0:49:05.280
We're getting bore meat 
faster than we're eating it.

0:49:15.040,0:49:24.240
torches. We just don't need more torches.

0:49:24.240,0:49:31.840
And we probably don't need more bor trophies 
either. I'm pretty sure we have a stack of 20.

0:49:31.840,0:49:40.320
All right, until next time. Maybe I can jump on 
a little later this evening and we'll continue

0:49:40.320,0:49:51.680
uh exploring our homeland and trying to find the 
last axe head for the early axes. I'm Grandpa Bud.

0:49:51.680,0:49:58.960
Thanks for joining us. We really do appreciate 
having you here to enjoy this with us. Yeah.
