## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
he Great Green is playing tricks on an old man’s eyes. My boots are thin, and the northern mist is thick. But the Norns provided a warm fire and a stout friend when I needed them most.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as his northern expedition takes a turn for the better. While the Mysterious Axe Head remains hidden in the brush, a chance encounter with the merchant Haldor has granted Conrad the Megingjord. With new strength in his belt and the weight of the Wyrd lifted from his shoulders, the hunt for the 5th Anniversary relics continues into the distant isles.
