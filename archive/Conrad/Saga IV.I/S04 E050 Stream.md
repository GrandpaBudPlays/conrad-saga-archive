# The Whale-Road’s Secret: Conrad's Exile (Saga 4 Ep. 50) | Grandpa Plays Valheim

My boots are thin from walking the Great Green. The Curious Axe Head is found, but the Mysterious one hides still. Today, we continue our search across the whale-road.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as he leaves the comfort of Othala-Garth to challenges across the Whale-Road. We push into the eastern horizons to scour distant shores for the final 5th Anniversary Relic and complete the Bronze Age Skip.

### 🎙️ DRAFT INTRO
"The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. 

Now, listen close Exiles. We’ve walked every inch of the Great Green on our home continent, Othala-Garth. We’ve fought through two Echoes of the Past and found the Curious Axe Head twice over, but that location of the other remain Mysterious. One the Norns are keeping from us—it isn't here and my boots are wearing thin. 

So, today, we’re leaving Othala-Garth behind. We’re takisearch across to the Whale-Road to east. We need that final relic to finish our set, and if it means crossing the deep water to find a new patch of Meadow, then that’s what we’ll do. Let’s see what this new land has in store for an old man."
