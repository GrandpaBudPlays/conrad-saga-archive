# Strength of the Merchant: Conrad's Exile (Saga 4 Ep. 51) | Grandpa Plays Valheim

The Great Green is playing tricks on an old man’s eyes. My boots are thin, and the northern mist is thick. But the Norns provided a warm fire and a stout friend when I needed them most.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as his northern expedition takes a turn for the better. While the Mysterious Axe Head remains hidden in the brush, a chance encounter with the merchant Haldor has granted Conrad the Megingjord. With new strength in his belt and the weight of the Wyrd lifted from his shoulders, the hunt for the 5th Anniversary relics continues into the distant isles.

### 🎙️ DRAFT INTRO
"The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.

Now, listen close. We’ve been scoured by the salt and the wind, searching for a scrap of the Great Green that the Norns haven't already picked clean. My spirit was starting to flag, and my pack was feeling heavier with every step. But then, tucked away in the trees, I found a familiar face. Haldor was waiting with his fire and his wares. I’ve traded my hard-earned coin for a new belt—the Megingjord. My back feels younger already, and my stride is sure. We haven't found that Mysterious Axe Head yet, but with this new strength, we're going to push further north than ever before. Let’s see what else the islands are hiding."
