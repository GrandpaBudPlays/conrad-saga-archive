## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
One shard down. The ruins finally gave up the Curious Axe Head. The shadows of the mountains reached into the Meadows and took the pigs, but they left behind a trail to something stronger.

Conrad has retreated to the Westshore, pausing his carpentry to hunt for the fabled Early Axes. With new peaks sighted on the home horizon, the old man longs for the cry of the wolf to break the silence of his exile. One shard is ours; the second won't stay hidden for long.
