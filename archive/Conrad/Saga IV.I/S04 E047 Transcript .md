## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:07.120,0:00:14.560
Excuse me again. I should clear my for my voice 
before I should clear my throat before I start

0:00:14.560,0:00:25.920
talking. Anyway, we're back continuing 
the search for the early axes. Hopefully

0:00:25.920,0:00:36.320
we hopefully we can find these before we 
have to go sailing in search of new meadows.

0:00:36.320,0:00:45.600
I would love to have them on our homeland.

0:00:55.680,0:01:00.480
You know,

0:01:00.480,0:01:07.120
watch walking across the floor just there. I'm 
real tempted. We're We're running through the

0:01:07.120,0:01:14.080
meadows and we're heavily armored for 
the mountains. Completely unnecessary.

0:01:14.720,0:01:21.360
Let's Let's try a lighter uh

0:01:21.360,0:01:30.080
load. Maybe we can get around quicker

0:01:30.080,0:01:36.880
in this troll armor. It definitely You can 
feel it when you're running and walking.

0:01:36.880,0:01:48.240
It's so much snappier and quicker. It's a 10% 
difference. and our stamina will last longer. So,

0:01:48.240,0:02:01.360
let's give that a shot. Okay, we're going to 
grab this uh before we take a look at the map.

0:02:01.360,0:02:12.480
Looks like we got all the pieces to the portal. 
So, let's uh get ready to travel. So, this looks

0:02:12.480,0:02:19.600
like just kind of a peninsula string of islands 
that we're going to finish out with. And then you

0:02:19.600,0:02:34.160
we have this. This is all black forest. This is 
mountains. And we have this much left. After that,

0:02:34.160,0:02:44.160
we've got some land over here, but we know this 
is partially plains and partially swamp. So,

0:02:44.160,0:02:54.800
let's finish out this peninsula. We'll double back 
and then we'll pick up the search right back here.

0:02:54.800,0:03:02.160
So, we got a little black forest 
and we don't need to go in it,

0:03:02.160,0:03:09.360
but I'm doing it just because I want 
to see the extent of this coastline.

0:03:12.480,0:03:17.440
It's uh

0:03:17.440,0:03:24.320
just my desire to have a complete map. There's

0:03:24.320,0:03:35.920
no reason to be out here doing 
this. Doesn't serve our purpose

0:03:35.920,0:03:38.400
other than I love to pick blueberries.

0:03:47.040,0:03:52.000
We got a spawner out here.

0:03:52.000,0:03:54.720
This is bigger than I expected. I thought it

0:03:54.720,0:04:04.480
was just this little thin peninsula. 
But let's get ready for this spawner.

0:04:04.480,0:04:07.120
What was got a skeleton?

0:04:10.720,0:04:19.760
So, I call them spawners. Officially, 
they're called a great dwarf nest.

0:04:19.760,0:04:34.960
Each one contains one of those. Ancient seeds 
that we needed for calling down the elder.

0:04:34.960,0:04:40.800
and we'll save him just in case we 
ever want to call him again. Uh,

0:04:40.800,0:04:57.440
that was a bear or possibly a troll, but 
I definitely heard somebody growl at us.

0:04:57.440,0:05:00.800
I think it's a troll.

0:05:02.880,0:05:10.160
I don't really want to stop 
for a troll fight right now.

0:05:10.160,0:05:16.960
So hopefully we're sneaky enough to 
get by him. And then we got another

0:05:16.960,0:05:24.480
great dwarf nest up ahead. I feel like 
uh the land has deceived me. I thought

0:05:24.480,0:05:47.040
we were on a peninsula. Now I'm not 
really seeing that. Got a brute here.

0:05:47.040,0:05:56.080
Yeah, I thought that guy was destroyed. 
Okay, got to take a peek at the map here.

0:05:56.080,0:05:57.840
Were

0:06:00.720,0:06:09.200
Huh. It's going to be interesting. I'm 
real curious to see how this shapes up.

0:06:09.200,0:06:16.000
That's where we just came from.

0:06:21.200,0:06:25.520
Looks like we've got a 
copper vein, copper deposit,

0:06:25.520,0:06:40.480
and a burial chamber with a two 
star, one star skelly out front.

0:06:40.480,0:06:44.800
Don't shoot me right now. I'm kind of busy.

0:06:47.680,0:06:57.440
That did not work. All right, 
we're not losing much health. So,

0:06:57.440,0:07:04.080
not too worried about him shooting arrows 
right now because he doesn't realize he's

0:07:04.080,0:07:12.640
not hitting us. Maybe we should get 
a weapon out. Works much better.

0:07:14.160,0:07:20.320
All right.

0:07:20.320,0:07:26.240
This is practically its own island

0:07:26.240,0:07:30.480
cuz that little continent of land, 
little peninsula of land that we

0:07:30.480,0:07:38.800
used to come out here was really 
thin. But now it got real wide.

0:07:47.760,0:08:00.160
And there's a swamp. Where? That's 
certainly unexpected. Somehow

0:08:00.160,0:08:07.920
I didn't think that that was going to double 
back all the way back to this part, but it does.

0:08:09.280,0:08:16.080
So that's um that's just really interesting.

0:08:16.080,0:08:25.040
So we've got some swamp. I'll be.

0:08:25.040,0:08:32.640
Now, I may have regret having 
changed into light armor,

0:08:32.640,0:08:42.240
but we're not going to go too far into the swamp.

0:08:42.240,0:08:45.920
Do we have more mountains here?

0:08:49.760,0:09:02.000
Got another copper deposit. And 
yes, we have more mountains here.

0:09:02.000,0:09:06.000
Just want enough to make it clear. Oh,

0:09:06.000,0:09:14.800
and there's a little bit of meadows here. 
So, that was un certainly unexpected.

0:09:19.440,0:09:27.520
What a great little place to 
hide the axe head would be

0:09:27.520,0:09:39.440
in this little section of 
meadows that nobody comes to.

0:09:39.440,0:09:49.280
Well, I'd hoped that we were searching 
another part of the land, but it looks like

0:09:49.280,0:09:55.440
I switched things up.

0:09:55.440,0:10:03.280
All right, let's get back 
to the edge of the swamp.

0:10:08.560,0:10:14.800
And there's an A-frame style 
house. Is it the A-frame style

0:10:14.800,0:10:23.440
house we're looking for? That I am not sure of.

0:10:23.440,0:10:26.640
Looks like we're out of luck this time. Okay,

0:10:26.640,0:10:32.560
we probably don't need rocks. We 
don't need any more ancient seeds.

0:10:34.640,0:10:41.520
We really don't need plant. And you 
can keep these axes, too. I mean,

0:10:41.520,0:10:55.520
these torches. We don't need those. Don't need 
another great dwarf trophy. Got to keep the eyes.

0:10:55.520,0:11:01.360
Don't need bones.

0:11:01.360,0:11:09.680
Not not in a great need of any of this stuff. So,

0:11:09.680,0:11:19.200
let's just put it in here and they can 
keep it while we continue searching.

0:11:19.200,0:11:28.320
Not much of a swamp, but there is some there.

0:11:28.320,0:11:34.160
I wouldn't mind finding a

0:11:34.160,0:11:39.440
iron mine right there or sunken crypt.

0:11:39.440,0:11:46.960
But they're pretty hard to 
spot if you don't go in the

0:11:46.960,0:11:55.120
forest itself. All right, there's the end 
of the swamp. That looks like meadows.

0:11:55.120,0:12:07.360
Let's Let's quickly run back here and 
finish off this section of the mountains

0:12:07.360,0:12:14.560
for completeness on our 
map, which that looks good.

0:12:14.560,0:12:19.760
And

0:12:26.800,0:12:35.200
Oh, we're going to run into the 
planes as we keep going this way.

0:12:35.200,0:12:45.840
So, we want to keep an eye out for that 
cuz that can be detrimental to your health.

0:13:07.360,0:13:09.360
don't have any poison resistance,

0:13:09.360,0:13:15.200
so I don't really want to run into 
that blob. I mean, we're not here for

0:13:17.280,0:13:25.440
anything but the early axe. So, this swamp

0:13:25.440,0:13:29.360
isn't

0:13:29.360,0:13:38.640
isn't going to get searched out this today.

0:13:38.640,0:13:42.640
But we got some more bore meat ahead.

0:14:01.840,0:14:08.000
couple of deer. We don't need

0:14:15.280,0:14:21.760
Uhoh. This looks like it could be.

0:14:21.760,0:14:34.880
Yes, I hear him. This is a diverger. 
Diverger. Diverger. However you pronounce it.

0:14:34.880,0:14:42.080
Buildings. Now, if the early axe is in there,

0:14:42.080,0:14:48.560
I don't know if we're going to go get it today,

0:14:48.560,0:14:57.840
especially not with our light armor.

0:14:57.840,0:15:06.080
But boy, I am so tempted to go for 
it. It's a kind of a stupid idea.

0:15:12.160,0:15:23.360
Drew Duger. I can't remember 
even how they spell their name.

0:15:23.360,0:15:31.680
That was a weird sound. What 
was that? Didn't recognize it.

0:15:48.480,0:15:54.160
I'm surprised he's not being stung by the bees.

0:15:54.160,0:15:59.040
D R A U G R

0:16:06.480,0:16:12.640
They're poison resistant anyway, 
so it really wouldn't matter.

0:16:12.640,0:16:22.960
He doesn't have a spawner in his house. 
So if Or does he? I don't see one.

0:16:23.760,0:16:33.920
So if I can take him out.

0:16:33.920,0:16:43.440
Oh well, there he goes.

0:16:43.440,0:16:49.360
Come on.

0:16:49.360,0:16:51.280
There you go.

0:16:54.160,0:17:13.760
This is uh suicidal.

0:17:32.800,0:17:42.000
I want to take out that roof piece so

0:17:42.000,0:17:53.280
I can shoot the spawn. The body pile, I 
believe, is what they call it. Not hitting.

0:17:53.280,0:18:08.160
Must be to the left. Now I'm out of stamina. 
Oh, look. Now we can take out the body pile.

0:18:14.400,0:18:20.000
Health is getting low.

0:18:20.000,0:18:31.920
Her aim is not going to get us, so that's 
good. We've got the hill protecting us.

0:18:31.920,0:18:41.280
Having

0:18:41.280,0:18:50.960
this elevation advantage for taking 
out the body piles. Very handy.

0:18:50.960,0:18:58.640
Oh, come on. Back here.

0:18:58.640,0:19:00.880
We didn't get our rested bonus.

0:19:03.600,0:19:12.640
That's too bad.

0:19:12.640,0:19:18.320
Maybe we just do that here.

0:19:18.320,0:19:25.440
At least get some because our

0:19:25.440,0:19:29.840
Oh, I don't have the I don't 
have the stones for it.

0:19:33.680,0:19:45.360
Hold still right there. I got you.

0:19:58.560,0:20:06.480
Looking for a treasure chest. I 
don't see one. Want to be careful

0:20:06.480,0:20:11.920
that I don't get any undue attention.

0:20:15.680,0:20:36.400
Well, it seems like night came awfully early.

0:20:44.880,0:20:50.240
All right, let's uh

0:20:50.240,0:20:56.640
let's head back to base camp.

0:21:01.360,0:21:10.080
Just need some uh flat ground that we can

0:21:10.080,0:21:25.520
easily put a portal on. This looks promising.

0:21:34.800,0:21:46.080
You know, I should have started this before 
I started the fight with the Drew Guard.

0:21:46.080,0:21:53.440
D R A U G R. Is that what we said?

0:21:53.440,0:22:00.320
And that's in the wrong place. 
Let's mark it when we get back.

0:22:00.320,0:22:19.760
Here we go.

0:23:10.000,0:23:14.000
There we get them all back on 
the same timer, all the food,

0:23:14.000,0:23:23.760
so they all run out at the same time. That 
makes it easier to manage, at least for me.

0:24:53.120,0:24:59.760
I want to get close to see if I can 
hear a body pile. And I don't. So,

0:24:59.760,0:25:02.400
we're going to try to take this

0:25:13.520,0:25:19.440
That was not too bad.

0:25:19.440,0:25:24.800
Very little damage to us.

0:25:24.800,0:25:30.400
Cleared this building. So, now we 
got the big hall to clear and we

0:25:30.400,0:25:39.440
can't get the elevation on it. 
But is there a body pile in it?

0:25:39.440,0:25:43.520
Yeah. You hear those flies?

0:25:43.520,0:25:53.280
Yeah. There's the body pile in 
there. And we got at least two

0:25:53.280,0:26:02.240
two Dugger Dger. You tell me. I don't know.

0:26:02.240,0:26:16.080
And I'm not seeing uh there's no opening where 
we can get elevation and shoot down on it.

0:26:16.080,0:26:21.520
And then there's a body pile in here.

0:26:21.520,0:26:29.280
And we got one bow bow person so 
far. Once we step in there though,

0:26:29.280,0:26:45.040
there's going to be a second person spawn. 
Let's see what we can do from up here.

0:26:45.040,0:26:52.000
Any chance I can stand up there? 
No. He was my canary in the coal

0:26:52.000,0:27:00.080
mine. When we were here earlier, I was 
using him running around the buildings

0:27:00.080,0:27:11.120
to let me know if there were any 
druggers that were out and about,

0:27:11.120,0:27:24.320
but it looked like all of them were kind of 
stuck in the building. So, let's do this. Let's

0:27:24.320,0:27:31.360
get a little elevation.

0:27:31.360,0:27:38.160
If we could charge in there and just take this 
out. I mean, that'd be the easy way to do it. Ah,

0:27:38.160,0:27:43.600
look at those two looking up at 
us. What are you doing on my house?

0:27:44.320,0:27:49.520
There's no body pile in this building, 
so we should be able to take it out.

0:27:49.520,0:28:05.600
But I think we can get a shot 
on the body pile from here.

0:28:05.600,0:28:10.000
Yeah, maybe not.

0:28:15.920,0:28:28.480
Now, if she breaks out before we get in, we'll 
have a more interesting fight on our hand.

0:28:28.480,0:28:39.440
I think we're hitting the body pile. We're 
getting 15 damage on something. There's 32 even.

0:28:39.440,0:28:45.920
Hopefully, it's not the wall. I don't want 
to take the wall out until the body pile's

0:28:45.920,0:29:00.000
gone. There. I saw the body pile even 
uh kind of splash up that time. So,

0:29:00.000,0:29:04.560
not that time.

0:29:04.560,0:29:12.320
That looked promising. There we 
go. So, there's the body pile.

0:29:12.320,0:29:16.400
I think I can get the jogger from here. Let's just

0:29:16.400,0:29:29.840
go do her. Let's take these two out 
first, though. Get that shield ready.

0:29:29.840,0:29:31.920
There we go.

0:29:33.360,0:29:44.080
Now, this is an A-frame house, but is 
it possible it's guarded by joggers? I

0:29:44.080,0:29:59.840
doubt it. I just don't think that's the idea 
behind the early axes. Okay, now this one.

0:29:59.840,0:30:07.440
so much easier with those body piles gone 
and we don't have to worry about somebody

0:30:07.440,0:30:15.440
like an elite popping out of it when we're 
low on stamina or low on health. All right,

0:30:15.440,0:30:25.840
the only one we've got left is the main building

0:30:25.840,0:30:31.280
and there's just there's no opening. So,

0:30:31.280,0:30:46.880
this is going to be the one that 
gets us killed. Let's do it.

0:30:46.880,0:30:55.120
There's the elite and the archer.

0:30:55.120,0:31:04.320
And we let our stamina run down 
now. very very poorly executed.

0:31:04.320,0:31:13.600
We We could be a lot smarter in our execution, but

0:31:13.600,0:31:19.200
I think we might test out the

0:31:19.200,0:31:24.800
root armor that we have.

0:31:24.800,0:31:26.480
Where did we put that?

0:31:28.880,0:31:32.720
There it is.

0:31:32.720,0:31:38.160
So, that chest piece should be 
good against the arrows. And

0:31:38.160,0:31:54.960
then let's match that with the rest of our iron.

0:31:54.960,0:32:03.760
We've got our bandit shield. That's not bad. Don't 
have a great weapon. The bronze axe. It's not

0:32:03.760,0:32:19.120
terrible. It's not quite as good as our uh bronze 
mace. Okay. So, we've got 23 to 37 or 17. So,

0:32:19.120,0:32:26.720
we're going to go with the mace. Not as good 
as our iron mace, but it's not bad. Now,

0:32:26.720,0:32:37.280
there's the advantage to having dropped the 
portal first, unlike what we did previously.

0:32:37.280,0:32:44.640
This is going to be a little 
lower than what we had,

0:32:44.640,0:32:55.440
but shouldn't be too bad. same stamina food, 
same sausages. Uh, but the cooked bear meat

0:32:55.440,0:33:10.640
doesn't quite keep up with the other food we had. 
However, we can throw some of these on our hot bar

0:33:10.640,0:33:14.800
for an emergency.

0:33:14.800,0:33:23.760
We should be in good shape. That's 
uh one more tick of a of health

0:33:23.760,0:33:41.120
and then we'll take we'll take 
out that body pile and that elite

0:33:41.120,0:33:45.360
just bad bad planning on my part 
running in there without stamina.

0:33:47.040,0:33:55.600
Okay, there's the archer. They're outside now.

0:33:55.600,0:34:04.160
That's looks like a star. 
Yeah, that's a one star archer.

0:34:04.160,0:34:11.040
Now that elite's around here somewhere.

0:34:11.040,0:34:26.560
She's still stuck up on top 
there. Oh. And another archer.

0:34:26.560,0:34:35.920
Got the body pile. So, we're in pretty good shape.

0:34:35.920,0:34:43.440
All right. We're just going to have 
to uh double up some stuff here.

0:34:47.200,0:34:57.760
Don't really need a torch. I wish that 
was a chest instead of my corpse, though.

0:34:57.760,0:35:05.760
Have we got a There's no chest in here. 
Actually, this is a neat trick. Uh first

0:35:05.760,0:35:16.800
time you've been in one of these buildings. 
Let's drop a U crafting table down here

0:35:16.800,0:35:28.320
because I think we're out of range of any of our 
other ones. And let's tear this platform apart.

0:35:28.320,0:35:38.480
So, just so we can see what we're doing here, 
let's take out these walls and that floor.

0:35:38.480,0:35:40.560
And you'll almost always find

0:35:42.960,0:35:54.000
a treasure chest or two underneath the this 
platform. When you find this type of building,

0:35:54.000,0:36:02.160
I don't think we're really hurting for

0:36:02.160,0:36:09.440
arrows, so going to leave them behind. 
We are short on our own arrows.

0:36:12.000,0:36:19.600
So maybe we should grab some of these.

0:36:19.600,0:36:28.720
And we definitely need to repair.

0:36:28.720,0:36:35.200
I don't know that we need one piece of corewood.

0:36:57.840,0:37:02.240
There we go.

0:37:02.240,0:37:06.960
And we should probably pick this up

0:37:06.960,0:37:11.760
because we don't need it here. I like this 
building design. I think it's pretty cool.

0:37:11.760,0:37:19.840
Really good. Great hall for the diverger. What? 
Somebody tell me how to pronounce that. The

0:37:19.840,0:37:31.440
Dugar. I'm going to call him Drewar. Droger. 
No, I'll call him Droger. I You know what?

0:37:31.440,0:37:35.440
Or these guys.

0:37:35.440,0:37:40.560
All right, let's see if we can find 
our portal. Let me get you right here.

0:37:42.640,0:37:50.800
We'll drop off this excess stuff we have.

0:37:50.800,0:38:02.720
Switch back to star straight up troll 
hide with the 15% sneak. It's kind of

0:38:02.720,0:38:09.120
the way I want to run.

0:38:24.480,0:38:35.520
Let's get our regular iron mason buckler.

0:38:35.520,0:38:37.440
We could have used our iron axe. No,

0:38:37.440,0:38:48.240
we didn't have it with us. Never mind. 
It's not very smart thing to say.

0:38:48.240,0:38:58.800
Put that root armor back. Do some quick repairs. 
We got just a couple minutes of daylight left.

0:39:01.200,0:39:07.280
I'm not sure it's worth the time 
to portal back, pick up the portal,

0:39:07.280,0:39:20.880
and then have to reset it later tonight. So, let's 
go without it. Let's just get a good night's rest.

0:39:20.880,0:39:27.600
Well, we're not finding the axes, but we 
are finding out the extent of our homeland.

0:39:33.040,0:39:38.960
Now, we're going to be real careful 
because we're wandering around in the

0:39:38.960,0:39:56.640
early dawn. And the next thing that we're 
probably going to find is the planes.

0:39:56.640,0:40:04.880
Yep. So, we know there's 
planes real close to here.

0:40:04.880,0:40:24.400
Let's head back to the village and 
map that coastline up to the plains.

0:40:32.880,0:40:38.160
That would have been actually quite 
the adventure had they been guarding

0:40:38.160,0:40:44.960
the last early axe head. That 
would have been so fitting.

0:40:44.960,0:40:51.680
that tower.

0:40:51.680,0:40:59.280
I think that's a fueling tower.

0:40:59.280,0:41:12.800
And this is not the kind of 
building we're going to find.

0:41:12.800,0:41:14.240
But that's the planes.

0:41:16.400,0:41:21.200
That's the edge of our meadows.

0:41:21.200,0:41:27.200
Don't want to get too close to that.

0:41:27.200,0:41:41.120
But I am going to go as far 
as the pig farm over there.

0:41:41.120,0:41:46.000
Now that there's definitely 
going to be fuelings there. So,

0:41:46.000,0:42:07.040
we're going to hight tail it out of here.

0:42:07.040,0:42:10.000
Pretty pretty uh

0:42:13.680,0:42:22.080
Easy to get killed right here.

0:42:22.080,0:42:33.200
Something killing boores nears by and they're 
probably coming out of the plains to do it.

0:42:33.200,0:42:38.560
Now there's that area. Looks like 
the plains meets the mountains.

0:42:51.680,0:43:00.960
but it's identifying as all 
meadows. So, let's let's uh

0:43:00.960,0:43:06.000
let's just try to draw out these mountain areas.

0:43:14.240,0:43:23.120
Now we're freezing. That's not good.

0:43:23.120,0:43:31.920
And now we're at the edge of the plains. 
So that's as far as we go that way.

0:43:31.920,0:43:34.480
I want to quit freezing.

0:43:36.720,0:43:48.000
And we'll just skirt the 
mountains here to finish out our

0:43:48.000,0:43:57.040
Nothing Chasing us. That's good. All 
right, let's uh check the map here.

0:43:57.040,0:44:05.040
So, I think we've filled all this in. Looks 
like we want to run back to the Black Forest

0:44:05.040,0:44:28.400
edge right here. Skirt around that side of the 
mountains. So, let's uh let's head that way.

0:44:38.080,0:44:49.600
where the mountains and the meadows meet is 
deceiving to me. It really looks like it's

0:44:49.600,0:44:53.280
All right,

0:44:53.280,0:45:00.560
come back here. We'll play. Wish I had 
you back at the home base. Or better yet,

0:45:00.560,0:45:17.840
West Shore. Take that one store star born. 
Start breeding us in their sound of pigs.

0:45:57.440,0:46:07.680
gets narrow here between 
the mountains and the swamp.

0:46:07.680,0:46:12.160
All ground that we've already covered.

0:46:49.600,0:46:56.160
Well, these mountains look promising 
for maybe a trip to get us some

0:46:56.160,0:47:07.200
uh wool someday. Getting them back 
home would not be will not be easy.

0:47:24.320,0:47:30.720
So, from here on in, it's Black Forest.

0:47:30.720,0:47:34.640
And I think we can kind of What's that over there?

0:47:34.640,0:47:50.160
That says Black Forest and that 
is still Black Forest to plains.

0:47:50.160,0:47:56.080
That's Meadows.

0:47:56.080,0:48:04.160
All right, let's keep scouting 
out the edge of this of these

0:48:04.160,0:48:15.600
mountains. Even though it's the black 
forest, we're going to head back into bear.

0:48:15.600,0:48:21.360
Tired of bears.

0:48:21.360,0:48:25.280
Now we're freezing again.

0:48:33.280,0:48:37.360
Where'd you go?

0:48:37.360,0:48:44.400
That is not the kind of treasure 
chest we're going to find anything in.

0:48:44.400,0:48:50.720
Can stack those up. All right.

0:49:02.320,0:49:09.440
I just want to see the edge of the mountains.

0:49:09.440,0:49:18.880
So, we'll leave the uh adventuring for 
another day. This is strictly mapping.

0:49:46.720,0:49:48.320
I would have thought we would

0:49:56.960,0:50:02.880
some land that we'd already 
explored somewhere in here,

0:50:02.880,0:50:10.160
but so far no go.

0:50:10.160,0:50:16.400
Big copper deposit. Lots of mountains.

0:50:19.600,0:50:22.400
which is Oh, even a I hear a wolf. So,

0:50:22.400,0:50:43.520
that's very promising for our ability 
to tame some wolves in these mountains.

0:50:46.800,0:50:54.960
I've never looked or paid attention to 
whether you can have more than one mo

0:50:54.960,0:51:07.440
excuse me motor alter. You've got more 
than one ether alter. The other altars

0:51:07.440,0:51:11.200
I've never looked for multiples.

0:51:13.680,0:51:22.000
Don't see a chest. So, let's move on.

0:51:22.000,0:51:28.880
And even if it was a chest, it wouldn't be 
the chest we're searching for. All right.

0:51:28.880,0:51:38.160
And there's our bear friend. 
Maybe we can barely get away.

0:51:42.000,0:51:47.360
Still scouting the edge of those mountains.

0:51:47.360,0:52:06.080
Another copper deposit. I have to think 
we had a hard time finding our first one.

0:52:06.080,0:52:25.680
All right, let's get some stamina back. Let's 
take a look. Oh, we got a whole train behind us.

0:52:25.680,0:52:29.840
Feels like

0:52:29.840,0:52:34.640
the sun's going down on our mountain retreat here.

0:52:38.160,0:52:50.000
So maybe this is a good time to throw down a 
portal. Let's check our map real quick. Oh yeah,

0:52:50.000,0:52:55.600
there is a good section of mountains there.

0:52:55.600,0:53:00.720
Yeah, we've got all that black forest 
and we're almost back to the meadows.

0:53:00.720,0:53:03.920
Let's make it to the meadows 
before we stop for the night.

0:53:06.480,0:53:09.360
I don't understand what happens. We started out,

0:53:09.360,0:53:20.720
all of them had the same 25 
minutes and now the deer meat

0:53:20.720,0:53:30.400
has run out before anything else. I don't 
I don't understand how that happens.

0:53:38.240,0:53:44.080
I hear the heavy footsteps of a troll.

0:53:44.080,0:53:48.880
Just don't see where he's 
coming from. There he is.

0:53:48.880,0:53:57.920
You come around this way and we're 
going to run around the other way.

0:54:06.320,0:54:16.880
Hopefully we lose him before we get to the 
meadows and this is nothing to worry about.

0:54:16.880,0:54:22.720
I think we lost him.

0:54:31.280,0:54:39.920
There goes the rest abed.

0:54:39.920,0:54:49.120
And here's the meadows. So, this is 
what we've been hoping to get back

0:54:49.120,0:54:58.960
to. And this is where we'll start our search. And

0:54:58.960,0:55:03.120
that will be

0:55:03.120,0:55:11.440
in another

0:55:11.440,0:55:24.640
episode of the search for the early axes. Going 
to wrap this one up right after we get home

0:55:24.640,0:55:31.440
and right after we search 
this last building right here,

0:55:31.440,0:55:41.280
which is an A-frame structure, but 
doesn't look extremely promising.

0:55:41.280,0:55:47.120
It's fairly dilapidated. There's 
a tree growing in the middle of

0:55:47.120,0:56:00.720
it. There's no treasure chest in 
here. There is a very off chance.

0:56:00.720,0:56:04.720
Extremely off chance that there's a treasures

0:56:04.720,0:56:14.000
chest inside that tree. But I 
seriously doubt that's the case.

0:56:14.000,0:56:18.560
would have to be perfectly placed. Okay,

0:56:18.560,0:56:33.040
we're not going to find out. Gonna put this 
down. Get our workbench on some level ground.

0:56:33.040,0:56:37.120
Drop our portal.

0:56:37.120,0:56:48.800
Jump back to home base. clean out inventory

0:56:48.800,0:56:59.440
and we'll pick it up. I can smell dinner. 
Grandma's probably waiting for me and I

0:56:59.440,0:57:04.640
should be hurrying there because if 
she's going to take the time to cook,

0:57:04.640,0:57:08.880
the least I can do is show up on time.

0:57:11.680,0:57:29.520
Oh, we got 50 already. Wow, that's 
way too fast. And we're way too full.

0:57:29.520,0:57:34.960
Let's get rid of the treasure 
that we can get rid of.

0:57:34.960,0:57:38.240
It's about time to Let's see.

0:57:39.440,0:57:53.920
We could free up a lot of slots if we go see 
Hilda. Hild deer. Don't make that mistake again.

0:57:53.920,0:58:03.760
If anybody knows why the food timings get out 
of sync because I know I started them both at

0:58:03.760,0:58:14.000
25. Let me know in the comments. That'd 
be grandma telling me it's dinner time.

0:58:14.000,0:58:19.760
I better hurry.

0:58:19.760,0:58:31.360
Rude of me to keep her waiting. Okay, we'll drop 
this in here. We don't need the that. Don't need

0:58:31.360,0:58:42.800
the eyes. That's it for all for now. Oh, that's it 
for now. I'm Grandpa Bud. We're playing Valheim.
