# Northward Bound: Conrad's Exile (Saga 4 Ep. 51) | Grandpa Plays Valheim

The Whale-Road is cold. My boat is small. The Great Green calls from the north. I will find that axe head before my fire goes out.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as he steers his vessel into the Northern Isles. We leave the familiar currents behind to scout new reaches of the Great Green, hunting for the elusive Mysterious Axe Head and the final secrets of the 5th Anniversary Relics.

### 🎙️ DRAFT INTRO
"The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. 

Now, listen close Exiles. Last time, we fought through the Echoes of the Past and scoured the eastern reaches, but the Norns are still holding onto that Mysterious Axe Head. My boots are thin andf patched, but my resolve isn't. Today, we’re pointing the prow north. There are islands up there that haven't seen a friendly face in a long age. We’re going to find a new patch of the Great Green and see if the north holds what the east hid from us. Let’s get to it."
