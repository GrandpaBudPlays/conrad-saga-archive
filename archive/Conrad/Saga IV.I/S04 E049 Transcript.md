## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:09.600,0:00:14.480
Welcome, fellow exiles. The mead is cold.

0:00:14.480,0:00:23.840
The hearth is warm. I'm Grandpa, 
and we're playing Valheim.

0:00:23.840,0:00:33.280
Pull up a stool, follow along. As today Conrad 
is setting out from Othala-Garth once more,

0:00:33.280,0:00:43.360
pushing into the eastern lands. We've got

0:00:43.360,0:00:50.080
We've got our eyes peeled for the elusive 
mysterious axe head. I found the curious

0:00:50.080,0:00:58.400
axe head twice now. But that other 
one, it he's a sneaky fellow. Those

0:00:58.400,0:01:04.560
anniversary relics are still out there 
hiding in the brush. It's a long trek

0:01:04.560,0:01:10.720
that will certainly test the old man's wind. 
And we'll have to be mindful of the weird's

0:01:10.720,0:01:20.720
wait as we explore these new horizons. Let's 
see what the Norns have in store for us today.

0:01:22.160,0:01:30.560
Going to grab that portal and head 
back to those eastern islands.

0:01:30.560,0:01:39.280
Okay, let's take a quick look 
at the map where we left off.

0:01:39.280,0:01:44.800
So, you can see we found a 
handful of uh possibilities,

0:01:44.800,0:01:52.240
none of them that would bore fruit 
for us. and we're exploring this new

0:01:52.240,0:01:58.320
uh island. Looking back, I thought that 
we might have missed a couple. Well,

0:01:58.320,0:02:07.760
first of all, let's let's grab this portal 
and stick it in our pocket and this workbench.

0:02:07.760,0:02:14.160
And there wasn't a whole lot in this 
chest that we need right now. But I

0:02:14.160,0:02:18.080
want to run back to the coast because I 
thought we might have missed something.

0:02:20.240,0:02:35.040
back here.

0:02:35.040,0:02:41.040
Just following along the edge of 
this black forest. I think we got a

0:02:41.040,0:02:49.520
uh intention of a Uhuh. What's going Oh, I'm 
on the wrong tool. There we go. I was trying

0:02:49.520,0:02:57.040
to fight off a boar with my hammer. The hammer 
just doesn't work as well as the mace. In fact,

0:02:57.040,0:03:05.040
you can't attack with a hammer at all. See, I 
thought that we might have passed a building. Oh,

0:03:05.040,0:03:13.600
it's not a building. That's a 
bear. Yeah, I got to watch that.

0:03:13.600,0:03:25.360
His

0:03:25.360,0:03:33.120
knock back really puts us in the dirt.

0:03:33.120,0:03:40.720
Should have dodge rolled on that one.

0:03:40.720,0:03:48.000
My timing's off. Trying to 
get those three hits combos

0:03:48.000,0:03:59.760
in between. And they're not timed just 
right. He'll attack before the second one.

0:03:59.760,0:04:06.320
Hey, now that's the first time I've noticed our 
trinket fire. See up there the upper right bronze

0:04:06.320,0:04:15.040
icon uh bronze pendant icon. Uh, we've got 
45 seconds there of the bron pendant effect.

0:04:15.040,0:04:21.760
Let's take a look at that real quick. That bronze 
pendant effect increases our stamina regeneration.

0:04:21.760,0:04:29.440
So, it makes it a little easier as for easier 
for us to stay in the fight. Um, looks like

0:04:29.440,0:04:36.080
we're running out of bacon. We better have another 
bite. Besides, it's always time for another piece

0:04:36.080,0:04:44.960
of bacon. Now, I thought I saw Yeah, right there. 
I think we ran right by this guy last time we were

0:04:44.960,0:04:57.280
here. Um, I'm surprised to see it so uh close to 
being in the Black Forest. I mean, to me, this

0:04:57.280,0:05:04.960
looks like it is in the Black Forest proper, but 
it's an A-frame. It just doesn't have our prize

0:05:04.960,0:05:19.040
in it. Okay. Let's uh trade these rocks for the 
amber. Amber at least we can trade it in at the

0:05:19.040,0:05:27.760
at the vendor if we ever find it. I'd really 
really like to find Aldor. Oh, while we're here,

0:05:27.760,0:05:36.000
let's mark this off our map saying we found 
it and we're moving on because it didn't work.

0:05:40.320,0:05:48.400
All right.

0:05:48.400,0:05:53.360
Still have that habit of always 
trying to grab every little stick

0:05:53.360,0:06:02.320
and every little raspberry that I 
see. We don't need that stuff. We're

0:06:02.320,0:06:04.800
We're a little further along than that.

0:06:07.600,0:06:17.520
Going to have to keep my eyes peeled so 
we don't miss buildings like that again.

0:06:17.520,0:06:22.880
Look at that. Another bear.

0:06:22.880,0:06:32.400
Isn't there a bear right there? Yeah. See him 
next to that tree just waiting for us. Now,

0:06:32.400,0:06:37.040
I don't know if we're looking for an 
A-RA with a roof or without a roof,

0:06:37.040,0:06:46.960
but I'm guessing it's the one with the roof, but 
we'll check this one out. Yeah, got a deer. We've

0:06:46.960,0:06:57.200
been to this one before. I would bet you anything 
that we put that deer trophy there ourselves. Yep,

0:06:57.200,0:07:07.920
it's even marked off on the map. Okay. I 
think we just caught up with where we were.

0:07:07.920,0:07:16.560
All right.

0:07:16.560,0:07:27.920
Well, if the worst thing that were to come out of 
this is we found Aldor the vendor, I'd be happy.

0:07:27.920,0:07:34.480
Haldor has couple of items that we 
want and as soon as we find him,

0:07:34.480,0:07:49.840
I'll be really happy to tell you all about him.

0:07:54.560,0:08:05.520
Got couple of bores here. You can 
certainly use the bore me since we

0:08:05.520,0:08:15.760
haven't had much time to spend at West 
Shore area finishing out West Thala.

0:08:50.640,0:08:58.160
Got a runstone here. I wonder 
if it's one we've seen before.

0:08:58.160,0:09:05.200
Give thanks to Frey for the rain and sun. For the 
shoots that break the earth's skin and for fruits

0:09:05.200,0:09:12.480
of that vine. Give thanks to Odin for flesh 
and bone. the smoke from the cooking fire,

0:09:12.480,0:09:21.440
the warm pelt, and the strength of your 
arm. Thank you, Frey. Thank you, Odin.

0:09:23.280,0:09:33.680
And please, Frey, help us 
find the curious axe head,

0:09:33.680,0:09:46.000
the elusive, mysterious axe head, so that we 
can complete our quest for the early axes.

0:09:50.560,0:09:59.760
I really love to see that 
vendor icon pop up on our map.

0:09:59.760,0:10:06.320
Oh, let's take a look inside this 
tower. It's not what we're looking for.

0:10:06.320,0:10:18.560
Oh no. Got a little uh little a big lag 
window there. Sorry about that. Exiles,

0:10:18.560,0:10:30.240
the weirds wait is upon us.

0:10:30.240,0:10:43.040
And the norm certainly spawn 
a new thread on that one.

0:10:47.840,0:10:56.160
So, I decided to give home 
base a name. The name. Oh,

0:10:56.160,0:11:04.640
look at now that looks like a 
promising A-frame. Full roof line.

0:11:04.640,0:11:11.840
Very A-frameish. No door though. And no prize.

0:11:15.920,0:11:26.160
Well, let's mark it off. There's 
another one bites the dust.

0:11:26.160,0:11:37.280
Anyway, uh came up with a name. Oh, look at 
that. We're right at the foot of the mountains.

0:11:37.280,0:11:40.640
That'll Oh, and I can hear a wolf up there.

0:11:44.240,0:11:50.640
It's too bad that's not homeland 
where we could take him home with us.

0:11:50.640,0:12:01.760
That is just a gorgeous view across 
the meadows and into the pines.

0:12:01.760,0:12:07.360
Sometimes the scenery is just breathtaking.

0:12:24.800,0:12:33.280
Going to cut down on our ability to

0:12:33.280,0:12:41.840
find structures though as our Little strip 
of meadows here starting to narrow on us,

0:12:41.840,0:12:55.600
squeezed between the black forest and 
the mountains and yet another runstone.

0:12:55.600,0:13:05.520
What has Ul got for us this time? On this spot, 
a tree fell on the head, and I cursed the gods.

0:13:10.320,0:13:13.840
Oh yeah, you got to watch 
those falling trees. They're

0:13:13.840,0:13:21.760
uh one of the leading causes 
of death in the meadows.

0:13:21.760,0:13:25.040
Oh, look at that big old copper deposit sitting

0:13:25.040,0:13:34.720
there. And I hear I think I hear 
one of the blue ghosts nearby.

0:13:41.360,0:13:45.440
I don't see him.

0:13:45.440,0:13:51.200
That was a very distinctive sound. 
Okay, so we're at the edge of where

0:13:51.200,0:13:57.920
the black forest meets the mountains. 
We're going to turn here and head back

0:13:57.920,0:14:20.800
along the mountain side and just keep 
filling out our grid pattern on the map.

0:14:21.920,0:14:39.840
We took this all right up to the black 
forest, didn't we? Looks like it.

0:14:39.840,0:14:49.520
So, let's follow the uh mountain line here. 
That is mountain line, not mountain lion.

0:15:00.640,0:15:18.560
could eat another bite. I guess 
we will. How about some sausages?

0:15:38.080,0:15:39.840
That's not an A-frame. So,

0:15:39.840,0:15:48.080
that's more than likely not the house 
we're looking for. Though, I do hear a

0:15:54.240,0:16:11.280
The sound of golden honey.

0:16:11.280,0:16:15.360
What do we want to get rid of here?

0:16:21.200,0:16:36.320
I hate to waste it, but there's 
just not enough use for that.

0:16:36.320,0:16:54.720
And it looks like uh the queen's out here. 
There we go. And no treasure chest for us.

0:16:54.720,0:17:02.800
So we'll mark that one as done and keep looking.

0:17:02.800,0:17:08.960
Ah, there's some echoes of the 
past. Let's check them out.

0:17:09.760,0:17:16.160
That's a good possibility as long as they're not

0:17:16.160,0:17:26.480
occupied. Oh, but they are

0:17:26.480,0:17:34.560
got a lot of the swamp men in there.

0:17:34.560,0:17:36.720
Here they come.

0:17:38.160,0:17:47.040
Let's uh see if we can find 
some protection from those bows

0:17:47.040,0:17:58.560
and then we should use our 
parry on this guy. There we go.

0:17:58.560,0:18:02.400
So, we got two or just one. Yeah, we got two.

0:18:02.960,0:18:12.880
It's going to make it difficult because 
they're alternating their shots.

0:18:12.880,0:18:19.360
There we go.

0:18:19.360,0:18:25.440
All right. Before we uh delve 
deeper into those echoes,

0:18:25.440,0:18:37.200
we need to put up a safety net. 
Let's uh let's head up to this uh

0:18:37.200,0:18:45.040
spot and

0:18:45.040,0:18:53.680
we can drop a recall portal 
just in case we need it.

0:18:53.680,0:18:57.280
Never hurts to be prepared.

0:19:04.080,0:19:14.720
That's why we always want to carry the 
wood. Enough wood for a crafting table.

0:19:14.720,0:19:24.880
Ah,

0:19:24.880,0:19:26.160
so

0:19:28.720,0:19:33.920
Seemed like a really

0:19:33.920,0:19:41.600
fast day, but nighttime's coming

0:19:41.600,0:19:51.520
and we want to um be prepared 
for the shadows of the dark.

0:19:56.800,0:20:05.920
All right, let's uh dole out our findings here.

0:20:05.920,0:20:14.960
Put them all away properly so that we can grab

0:20:14.960,0:20:19.760
the rest of the stuff that we left behind.

0:20:32.880,0:20:38.720
So, we've got the rested buff or 
the protection of the hearth. He

0:20:38.720,0:20:50.800
hearth earth. I don't know which way 
you say that. I think it's hearth. Um,

0:20:50.800,0:21:03.680
let's get some sleep and 
then we can start that fight

0:21:03.680,0:21:15.520
and not have to worry about a long boat ride back.

0:21:19.920,0:21:34.160
It's a lot more convenient if we 
don't have to take the whaler's way.

0:21:34.160,0:21:40.560
Well, I personally

0:21:46.320,0:21:49.520
Enjoy

0:21:49.520,0:22:01.840
the fight against these.

0:22:01.840,0:22:09.120
I thought I'd be able to jump through that window, 
but doesn't look like it's going to happen.

0:22:18.400,0:22:27.520
All right, we got a couple of uh walkers 
over there that aren't confined. So, let's

0:22:27.520,0:22:36.400
look at addressing them first. And we want to be 
sure we've got a full belly before we do that.

0:22:39.520,0:22:51.200
You hear that?

0:22:51.200,0:22:59.040
All right, we got to be more 
careful with our using our shield.

0:22:59.040,0:23:03.280
All right.

0:23:03.280,0:23:05.920
Yeah, we hear the sound of the body files.

0:23:06.640,0:23:16.400
The flies that swarm those body 
piles let us know that the respawn

0:23:16.400,0:23:20.480
is going to be there.

0:23:20.480,0:23:28.640
I don't see any uh any way for we 
get Oh, wait. That may be a beehive

0:23:28.640,0:23:41.920
and not a body pile. Let's see. Can 
we hit that beehive from this side?

0:23:41.920,0:23:45.760
There we go.

0:23:45.760,0:23:52.720
Now, I don't hear the swarm of

0:23:52.720,0:24:02.080
of flies around body pile, so I think we 
just have one or two in here to take out.

0:24:09.200,0:24:13.040
All right, that's two buildings down. Oh,

0:24:13.040,0:24:19.280
look at that. They knocked the 
wall out right before we came in.

0:24:19.280,0:24:27.440
All right, so we've got that 
building, that big building.

0:24:27.440,0:24:31.520
Oh, we got two big buildings. Three big buildings.

0:24:33.840,0:24:39.840
This is a

0:24:39.840,0:24:46.320
This was a big village when once upon a 
time. Let's see if we can stand on this

0:24:46.320,0:24:58.320
roof and take out that body pile. 
Going to drop a crafting table

0:24:58.320,0:25:00.720
and then put some ladders up this

0:25:03.360,0:25:15.360
building

0:25:15.360,0:25:22.800
and see if we've got the right angle on 
that body pile there. I don't know. I

0:25:22.800,0:25:29.200
uh don't know if we've got the height 
here. Let's add another ladder.

0:25:34.240,0:25:45.440
Now, of course, we could just storm 
that building and try to take out

0:25:45.440,0:26:02.480
the swamp men and the body pile at 
the same time. But if I can do it.

0:26:02.480,0:26:10.640
Oh, and the rain stopped. 
So, we're going to have the

0:26:10.640,0:26:15.200
I think uh

0:26:15.200,0:26:19.760
All right.

0:26:26.880,0:26:39.200
Looks like they broke out. Where did they get out?

0:26:39.200,0:26:46.960
Oh, I see. Right there.

0:26:46.960,0:26:59.040
All right. We got anything we don't need here? 
Yeah, lots. So, we'll pick up that fine wood.

0:26:59.040,0:27:10.800
And uh

0:27:10.800,0:27:15.600
I think

0:27:15.600,0:27:26.000
I think I'm going to head back and switch armor. 
Plus, there's no need to fight in this rain.

0:27:52.480,0:27:59.120
Let's pick up our root harness. uh that

0:27:59.120,0:28:06.880
will help with the uh arrows. Uh as you 
can see, it has the uh resistant versus

0:28:06.880,0:28:17.520
fierce. So even if we drop, and I don't think 
we are dropping, we we're trading uh 10 armor

0:28:17.520,0:28:23.520
to eight armor. So that's 
a drop of two armor points.

0:28:25.680,0:28:32.400
But the resistant versus pierce is 
going to make up for that. Now we

0:28:32.400,0:28:44.000
can pick up a couple of armor by trading 
our 10 armor pants for our iron greaves.

0:28:44.000,0:28:54.240
And so we're sacrificing our movement 
speed here for better armor class and

0:28:54.240,0:28:58.800
we have a pierce resistant from the root harness.

0:28:58.800,0:29:13.040
So since we're not running around the 
meadows and instead we're fighting.

0:29:13.040,0:29:24.160
We're fighting in a limited space. 
We're not that pressed for movement.

0:29:24.160,0:29:29.360
Wow. We have 20

0:29:29.360,0:29:35.520
Dger trophies.

0:29:35.520,0:29:43.200
That's amazing. I didn't know we had fought 
enough to pick up that many. And again,

0:29:43.200,0:29:58.560
we're running out of space for things. So, 
let's use these this extra area we have here.

0:29:58.560,0:30:07.920
Fill some of that in. Okay, we've got a stack 
of honey over here. We can add that to stack of

0:30:07.920,0:30:29.280
uh intrails. We can add to We need to 
find a home for that stack of deer meat.

0:30:38.880,0:30:41.520
Just trying to keep things organized as we keep

0:30:41.520,0:30:53.040
filling up more and more 
of our storage containers.

0:31:13.920,0:31:24.720
It's truly amazing how much 
stuff we have gathered.

0:31:34.800,0:31:53.920
Just assuming it's partially through the 
afternoon. Maybe we can sleep off this storm.

0:31:56.720,0:32:02.160
Well,

0:32:02.160,0:32:07.120
it's morning and we're still storming.

0:32:07.120,0:32:14.480
Though the sound of lightning and thunder 
is certainly lightening up a little bit,

0:32:14.480,0:32:18.320
I don't see an end to the storm in sight.

0:32:19.920,0:32:37.520
Let's head back over to the eastern lands and 
uh let's finish off those echoes of the past.

0:32:37.520,0:32:44.400
So, we're going to have the 
wet debuff a little slower

0:32:44.400,0:32:47.440
little slower stamina regen because of that.

0:32:59.920,0:33:14.000
Oh, another beehive. Holy cow.

0:33:19.120,0:33:24.800
So, we got at least one body pile in there. Let's

0:33:24.800,0:33:33.840
grab our bee first and then maybe 
we'll take this middle building.

0:33:33.840,0:33:40.320
How are we doing on food? We could use some bacon.

0:33:45.280,0:33:51.200
I don't see a body pile in this one, so 
it shouldn't be too bad. I miss them.

0:33:51.200,0:34:02.800
Missed the door. Oh, they're free. They 
could have walked out on us at any point.

0:34:08.240,0:34:17.520
Well, that's not the early axes. Let's get rid of 
these trophy. We don't need to carry that around.

0:34:17.520,0:34:22.640
And I don't have a good use for board trophies.

0:34:22.640,0:34:31.680
Windows just a little. All right, we're going 
to try to charge this. Keep the shield up.

0:34:32.720,0:34:43.040
deal with the body pile hopefully along 
with the Drew Guard at the same time.

0:34:43.040,0:34:53.360
An elite

0:34:53.360,0:35:01.040
we got a a few of them here 
and our health is dropping.

0:35:07.520,0:35:16.080
All right, three down, one to go. There we go.

0:35:16.080,0:35:22.480
So, we got uh

0:35:22.480,0:35:24.320
we got lucky on that one.

0:35:24.880,0:35:33.440
fairly efficient in taking out uh an 
elite, two archers, and an axeman.

0:35:34.960,0:35:40.640
However, we're not coming up

0:35:40.640,0:36:01.760
with our elusive prize.

0:36:05.760,0:36:14.000
So, we got a body pile in here. 
Let's see if we can uh All right,

0:36:14.000,0:36:23.920
we're we're down to five minutes on that sausage. 
Going to go ahead and uh get the extra health

0:36:23.920,0:36:30.000
uh that a new one will give us. So, eat 
that sausage. Get the extra What is that?

0:36:30.000,0:36:35.520
20 30 points of health that it gives 
us before we charge in there to take

0:36:35.520,0:36:45.040
out this body pile and the drew guard that 
are waiting for us. All right, up to 110.

0:36:45.040,0:36:50.240
We got another elite

0:36:50.240,0:36:55.040
body pile and elites down

0:36:55.040,0:36:57.920
multiple archers.

0:37:01.920,0:37:09.360
The old man's of wind is getting 
low here. There we go. Got both

0:37:09.360,0:37:20.960
of those archers in one swing 
of the mace. That was helpful.

0:37:26.560,0:37:33.520
So, another Droger village down. Wait,

0:37:33.520,0:37:46.560
I still hear one. I thought we got them all. 
Oh, there's this one. So, I almost left one.

0:37:46.560,0:37:50.160
We got two archers. No body pile.

0:38:02.400,0:38:11.760
And another beehive. What is that? 
Like three beehives in this uh village.

0:38:11.760,0:38:17.520
I'm beginning to think the droger like bees. 
Oh, we walked into that too soon and got poison.

0:38:18.080,0:38:22.320
So, keep in mind once you break that beehive,

0:38:22.320,0:38:31.440
you want to give the bees a minute to disperse. 
Let's go ahead and grab this um finewood. Break

0:38:31.440,0:38:42.800
those tables and chairs down and get the 
extra fine wood. It's there for the taking.

0:39:03.920,0:39:20.480
All right, let's mark these off our list.

0:39:28.400,0:39:31.360
Just bringing up the map with him,

0:39:31.360,0:39:44.400
making a mark to say we've been here 
and moving on to the next building.

0:39:44.400,0:39:54.960
I mean, it's I suppose it's pretty 
obvious we've been here because The

0:39:54.960,0:40:00.960
buildings are all cleared out. 
Got another chair there. So,

0:40:00.960,0:40:08.720
just a little more fine wood. 
But this way, if we ever need to,

0:40:08.720,0:40:19.120
we can look at the map. We'll know where 
that Dugar Village was once upon a time.

0:40:19.120,0:40:45.760
We did that one.

0:40:45.760,0:40:55.360
One, two, three, four, five, six buildings. 
on the map and one, two, three, four, five,

0:40:55.360,0:41:10.960
six, seven in the village. So I think this 
far one we didn't get on them on the map.

0:41:10.960,0:41:15.600
Is that right?

0:41:15.600,0:41:16.880
Yep.

0:41:19.040,0:41:28.800
All right. So, take a quick look at the map. 
We were following along this mountain. Uh,

0:41:28.800,0:41:43.600
and then we've got all of this uncharted 
along the coastline that we can go back over.

0:41:43.600,0:41:46.720
So, let's do that. Let's just follow this and kind

0:41:46.720,0:42:09.200
of fill in the map the way we came 
from just a little further inland.

0:42:24.880,0:42:27.200
I'm stuck behind a

0:42:43.760,0:42:49.840
What do we got over here?

0:42:49.840,0:42:55.040
One of those ancient stone circles.

0:42:55.040,0:43:04.880
I love the looks of those. I just 
wish they had some significance.

0:43:04.880,0:43:19.440
Perhaps someday that mystery 
will be uncovered for us.

0:43:19.440,0:43:22.320
Is that a building over there?

0:43:23.680,0:43:35.120
Ah, another skeleton arena.

0:43:35.120,0:43:48.960
I love this addition to the game.

0:43:52.240,0:43:58.000
A great place to come and challenge her

0:43:58.000,0:44:09.280
skills as a warrior.

0:44:09.280,0:44:24.560
Looks like there's a building over here. Or is 
that another village? More echoes of the past.

0:44:24.560,0:44:29.200
And these are occupied, too.

0:44:29.200,0:44:32.560
Oh,

0:44:32.560,0:44:37.680
had another raincoat moment. We left the portal

0:44:37.680,0:44:46.480
back there as our lifeline 
instead of picking it up.

0:44:46.480,0:44:58.320
All right. When they're solo like that, 
they're pretty easy to take care of.

0:44:58.320,0:45:03.280
Let's take a peek at what we 
got here. We got a body pile

0:45:03.280,0:45:15.360
and two axemen. Let's take that body pile out.

0:45:17.280,0:45:28.480
All right, they want to 
knock us out the door here.

0:45:28.480,0:45:36.080
There we go.

0:45:36.080,0:45:44.480
All the furniture we're tearing up. We're 
getting lots of uh free fine wood or multiple

0:45:46.320,0:45:58.480
We got an archer and an axeman.

0:45:58.480,0:46:05.040
So by taking the body pile out first, the

0:46:05.040,0:46:12.960
uh existing drowger will kind 
of serve as placeholders.

0:46:14.560,0:46:26.400
because the body pile won't spawn a new one until 
those existing drowger are killed. But if we want

0:46:26.400,0:46:34.960
the fight to drag out, we go for the drowger 
first and let the body pile keep spawning.

0:46:36.720,0:46:40.480
I don't find that's the most 
efficient way to survive,

0:46:40.480,0:46:48.640
but it will it will prove a challenge for 
you if you like a good challenge. All right,

0:46:48.640,0:46:57.520
we got a building over here 
that we haven't been in yet.

0:47:01.280,0:47:08.080
No body pile, but we have 
another beehive. Oh my gosh,

0:47:08.080,0:47:15.760
we're going to have more queens 
than we know what to do with.

0:47:15.760,0:47:22.880
So, let those calm down. And now we can approach, 
get the queen without having any problems. We

0:47:22.880,0:47:29.120
probably don't need a lot more flint. And if we 
do, it's easy to find. We don't need more jogger

0:47:29.120,0:47:43.280
trophies. So, let's leave those behind in the 
chest and let's go find the last of these dragger.

0:47:43.280,0:47:52.480
All right, check our health. Make sure we're 
eating. Let's get that uh health above 100 again.

0:47:54.080,0:47:59.200
And I can hear the body pile.

0:47:59.200,0:48:08.960
So, here we go. Wow, there's a lot of them.

0:48:08.960,0:48:19.440
Now, last time we didn't get the body pile 
first, but they were blocking the door on us, so

0:48:19.440,0:48:28.160
could sure use that. uh trinket to pop 
for us, but it's hard to get that stamina

0:48:28.160,0:48:42.240
up. Even when we fought three or four of 
them, we didn't pop that trinket. Now our

0:48:42.240,0:48:49.280
rested bonus is gone. We should head 
back and recover that power of the earth.

0:48:51.520,0:48:55.920
But there's one more building 
we haven't looked at. Oh,

0:48:55.920,0:49:06.560
there's more than one cuz I 
can hear people in this one.

0:49:06.560,0:49:18.000
No body pile and no no chest.

0:49:18.000,0:49:33.200
All right.

0:49:33.200,0:49:40.960
And no body pile. And no chest again.

0:49:40.960,0:49:45.360
I believe that's uh I think we've 
covered all the buildings on this one.

0:49:46.320,0:49:52.640
Let's mark them off the map.

0:49:52.640,0:49:56.000
And then we're going to have to run back and grab

0:49:56.000,0:50:23.600
our portal without a rested bonus. 
And night's coming on pretty quickly.

0:50:53.520,0:51:01.360
All right, let's use Eclar's power here.

0:51:01.360,0:51:12.720
See if we can't get back to that 
portal. Uh, right there real quick.

0:51:12.720,0:51:16.960
Now is when I wish I had 
brought the portal cuz that

0:51:19.680,0:51:25.040
10% reduction in speed by the

0:51:25.040,0:51:28.960
iron armor.

0:51:28.960,0:51:42.240
You notice it when you're 
trying to run cross country.

0:51:59.440,0:52:09.520
I think we missed this little 
building last time. Not anything here.

0:52:09.520,0:52:14.720
Wait a minute. Let's Guess that's 
just a plant sticking up through the

0:52:14.720,0:52:27.600
floor. Okay. Threw me. I thought 
maybe there was something there.

0:52:27.600,0:52:36.800
And there's our portal. Let's 
head back to our hearth and

0:52:46.880,0:52:54.720
and bring this day tune to a close. So,

0:52:54.720,0:52:57.920
saw several echoes of the past and

0:52:57.920,0:53:05.520
uh plenty of drowger occupants. We 
won't have to worry about those again.

0:53:07.360,0:53:12.880
Uh, but we had little success 
in the search for the curious

0:53:12.880,0:53:25.520
axe head. Mainly because most of 
our time was taken up with that

0:53:25.520,0:53:30.720
battle.

0:53:30.720,0:53:33.840
We now have 12

0:53:35.360,0:53:45.280
12 extra queen bees.

0:53:45.280,0:53:52.160
We have a ample supply of honey.

0:53:52.160,0:53:58.080
Then we picked up um

0:53:58.080,0:54:17.920
plenty of fine wood.

0:54:17.920,0:54:32.000
So, we'll sort this stuff out so 
that we can find it when we need it.

0:54:32.000,0:54:38.480
Well, the mead is cold, the 
hearth is warm. I'm Grandpa

0:54:38.480,0:54:44.720
Bud. We're playing Valheim. Y'all have a good one.
