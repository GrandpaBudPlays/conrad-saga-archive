## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The Meadows are wide, but our map is getting smaller. One Axe Head in the chest, one to go... and the Norns are making us work for it."

Welcome back to the live hunt! We are officially in Part III of the Early Axe Quest. These 5th Anniversary relics are the ultimate early-game "cheat code"—if we can just find both pieces, we can dual-wield our way through Fine Wood without ever touching a piece of Bronze.

The Story So Far:
In Part II, we pushed the boundaries of our homeland. We’ve successfully mapped the mountain outlines and skirted the coast of the inland sea. We have one Axe Head secured, but the second one is playing hard to get.

The Mission Today:
We are scouring the final remaining pockets of unexplored Meadows on our home continent. The goal is simple: find that last WoodHouse 2 (A-frame)  before we run out of land. If the second head isn't here, the search goes nautical—and nobody wants to hunt relics from a raft if they don't have to.
