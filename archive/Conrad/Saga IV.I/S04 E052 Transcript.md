## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:09.040,0:00:13.920
Welcome, exiles.

0:00:13.920,0:00:26.000
As you well know, or should know by now, the mead 
is cold, the hearth is warm. The saga continues.

0:00:26.000,0:00:35.440
I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. We've been 
scoured by the salt and the wind, searching for a

0:00:35.440,0:00:42.080
scrap of the great green that the Norns haven't 
already picked clean. My spirit was starting

0:00:42.080,0:00:50.240
to flag, and my pack was feeling heavier with 
every step. But then, tucked away in the trees,

0:00:50.240,0:00:59.040
I found a familiar face. Haldor was waiting with 
his fire and his wares. I've traded my hard-earned

0:00:59.040,0:01:07.680
coin for a new belt than me and George. My 
back feels younger already, and my strength

0:01:07.680,0:01:16.080
is sure. We haven't found the mysterious 
axe head yet, but with this new strength,

0:01:16.080,0:01:25.120
we're going to push further than ever before. 
Let's see what else the islands are hiding.

0:01:29.600,0:01:49.200
And we continue the search 
for the curious axe head.

0:01:49.200,0:01:54.160
Probably it wouldn't be a bad idea.

0:01:55.360,0:02:04.000
to grab yet another portal as we seem to be 
leaving them lying around left and right.

0:02:04.000,0:02:16.000
And then let's put away some of this uh fishing 
gear. We're not going to be using it right away.

0:02:16.000,0:02:20.160
Not that

0:02:25.120,0:02:35.040
The thing is, we keep gathering more and 
more items that we want to keep with us,

0:02:35.040,0:02:40.080
such as now we're going to be carrying 
around the diverger cirlet just in

0:02:40.080,0:02:48.800
case we run into a dark creepy hole 
that we want to be able to see in.

0:02:52.080,0:02:57.120
Well, let's head back to West Shore and grab us

0:02:57.120,0:03:05.840
another round of fine wood. I suppose 
we might as well take down the big oak.

0:03:07.440,0:03:15.680
Maybe he'll drop some acorns for 
us and we can plant some new ones

0:03:15.680,0:03:24.000
cuz we sure didn't get any uh seeds

0:03:24.000,0:03:35.520
for new birch trees.

0:03:35.520,0:04:00.800
And I don't see Oh, I think maybe we did get 
an acorn. Yes, several. Or at least a couple

0:04:09.840,0:04:16.160
So, that's enough fine wood,

0:04:16.160,0:04:27.600
and we'll leave the majority of the regular wood 
behind. We've got 42. We'll keep 20 some with us.

0:04:29.120,0:04:36.880
Let's go ahead and leave the 
acorns here along with the resin

0:04:36.880,0:04:44.720
and the finewood we're taking so that 
we can have two portals on the boat.

0:04:44.720,0:04:52.880
One for where we dock and one for when we travel.

0:04:59.120,0:05:12.320
Drop off this extra fine wood

0:05:12.320,0:05:16.800
and then let's pick up uh what we need for

0:05:16.800,0:05:22.080
a portal. Going to need an 
extra eye. Do we have some

0:05:24.720,0:05:30.880
Guess we'll break into the reserves.

0:05:30.880,0:05:47.120
Shouldn't take long to refill 
that though with only one missing.

0:05:52.480,0:05:57.840
Yeah, I have it right there, in fact. Okay. Uh,

0:05:57.840,0:06:14.080
we need an extra two of these. So, we've 
got double everything for two portals.

0:06:17.280,0:06:23.760
Now, we're going to be backing 
the boat down that river,

0:06:23.760,0:06:31.280
which is this way.

0:06:31.280,0:06:36.160
And I'm pretty sure we came around.

0:06:36.160,0:06:40.560
Yes, there's the boat.

0:06:49.600,0:07:07.360
I am real curious how far that river 
goes. But we got a buddy here or two.

0:07:16.000,0:07:26.960
I was hoping we wouldn't hit that.

0:07:26.960,0:07:35.840
Just drop a crafting table 
here for a second. Not going to

0:07:35.840,0:07:48.720
oblige us with black ground, but we can 
fix that. There we go. Quick repair.

0:07:48.720,0:07:54.400
And away we go.

0:07:54.400,0:07:58.000
Messed that up.

0:09:08.800,0:09:18.000
Just beneath the surface.

0:09:18.000,0:09:34.400
Of

0:09:34.400,0:10:02.160
Of course.

0:10:05.120,0:10:15.200
So, I hoped that there was an island in between.

0:10:15.200,0:10:25.280
Not sure there is, but maybe 
there's some land dragged here.

0:10:46.000,0:11:03.120
There's some here.

0:11:21.360,0:11:27.680
We make it lucky.

0:11:41.360,0:11:48.080
That is what we were looking for, is it not?

0:11:48.080,0:11:53.440
Hopefully that is not

0:11:53.440,0:11:55.760
planes.

0:12:02.800,0:12:12.240
Seems too close to the start to be blames. 
Oh, we know this land. We've been here.

0:12:12.240,0:12:22.320
Wait, we've been here, but 
yet we haven't been here.

0:12:56.240,0:13:04.000
Okay. So, we need to sail

0:13:04.000,0:13:08.400
north from here.

0:13:25.840,0:13:31.920
because we searched that land already.

0:13:31.920,0:13:37.920
Little more north.

0:13:37.920,0:13:44.960
I don't know.

0:13:44.960,0:14:01.600
Don't think we're going to find anything here.

0:14:46.160,0:14:53.680
going to turn into the wind, I suppose, 
cuz we're just approaching that

0:14:53.680,0:14:59.440
uh island that we were already on.

0:15:12.880,0:15:30.880
straight into the wind. That is not 
really the direction I want to be going.

0:15:30.880,0:15:38.800
So, we'll see if we can find some land over here.

0:15:44.800,0:15:49.760
Maybe we should search out.

0:15:49.760,0:15:55.840
It was all black forest.

0:15:55.840,0:16:04.000
Maybe we should circle this 
island where Aldor was.

0:16:04.000,0:16:20.240
Slow

0:16:20.240,0:16:21.920
going when we sail against the

0:17:09.520,0:17:31.200
There we go.

0:17:31.200,0:17:56.480
Wind shifted just when I thought 
we were getting some wind.

0:17:56.480,0:18:20.400
Let's check out that island. Besides, 
we can sail in with the wind this way.

0:19:16.160,0:19:26.480
this much sailing. We should be 
uh bringing that harpoon with us.

0:19:33.440,0:19:54.080
How did we miss that last time?

0:19:54.080,0:19:55.680
Not very big.

0:20:25.760,0:20:30.000
Got a beehive.

0:20:30.000,0:20:34.560
Let's take it out first.

0:20:34.560,0:20:48.080
And there's a troll nearby. I heard him growl. 
But where is the be? Oh, it's right there. Okay.

0:21:16.000,0:21:17.360
Wait, he's close.

0:21:29.440,0:21:42.960
And yet I still can't see him.

0:22:44.880,0:22:48.560
There he is.

0:22:48.560,0:22:56.800
Well, at least he's not carrying a tree with him.

0:22:56.800,0:23:13.600
Let's uh hop out of here real quick 
and we'll come back in the daylight.

0:23:22.480,0:23:30.000
That's where we keep the extra 
bees, but want to hang on to that.

0:23:30.000,0:23:34.240
That doesn't go there.

0:23:34.240,0:23:42.080
That doesn't really go there 
either. Put that away. Spice rack.

0:24:06.400,0:24:16.240
We should have more pinewood 
somewhere. Must have dropped it.

0:24:16.240,0:24:19.600
Yeah.

0:25:18.240,0:25:29.440
To sleep to him.

0:25:46.480,0:25:58.320
So, let's see if there's a building on this 
island and then we're probably going to head out.

0:26:13.280,0:26:42.240
Aha, a mysterious axe head. And now we have 
a new crafting recipe. The early axes. Our

0:26:42.240,0:26:55.680
search is over. So, what am I doing now? 
I guess just uh seeing where this leads.

0:26:58.560,0:27:05.600
Got a little uh swamp over here.

0:27:05.600,0:27:11.200
We could pull that troll into 
the swamp and have some fun.

0:27:11.200,0:27:22.880
And we got black forest.

0:27:42.240,0:27:50.480
So, I suppose we should head, 
shouldn't we? Head back home.

0:27:50.480,0:28:00.080
Take a look at what the early axes look 
like. Try them out a little on the meadows.

0:28:00.080,0:28:07.760
And then we return.

0:28:07.760,0:28:12.720
I'm not swimming after him.

0:28:15.840,0:28:40.080
And then we return to our 
hunt for the frozen tears.

0:28:49.120,0:29:04.080
And just for fun, let's mark this. Oh, 
howdor and early axe all in the same

0:29:04.080,0:29:15.920
general location. Was this 
the curious or the mysterious?

0:29:15.920,0:29:33.920
Mysterious. That's what I 
thought. I almost misnamed it.

0:29:33.920,0:29:54.080
Well, there we have it. The search is over.

0:29:54.080,0:30:01.840
We don't need another

0:30:01.840,0:30:04.400
portal on this island.

0:30:06.080,0:30:11.760
So, I think I'll grab this one

0:30:11.760,0:30:40.240
and we'll sail. We could sail to 
Haldor. Uh, might be the shortest trip.

0:30:40.240,0:30:47.760
We just sail out to sail 
over that. Oh, look at that.

0:30:47.760,0:30:57.680
He decided to come check us 
out right after we left. Oh my.

0:30:57.680,0:31:05.760
Very good timing on our part.

0:31:16.640,0:31:20.560
Well, there's those shallows.

0:31:20.560,0:31:31.200
Make tearing the boat down easier that way.

0:31:31.200,0:31:35.040
Now, we got to navigate this river opening.

0:31:41.120,0:31:45.200
Are are there two rivers?

0:31:45.200,0:31:55.200
There are.

0:31:55.200,0:31:59.360
Yep. Papa bear there.

0:31:59.360,0:32:03.360
Oh, these shallow rocks are just killing me.

0:32:10.960,0:32:20.640
I'm surprised to see a leech 
this far away from the swamp.

0:32:20.640,0:32:28.160
Well, that was a serious bump.

0:32:32.080,0:32:56.560
So, let's see if we can find a nice 
shallow to pull into close to Aldor.

0:32:56.560,0:33:01.200
These

0:33:01.200,0:33:12.880
gray dwarfs really like 
throwing rocks at our boat.

0:33:12.880,0:33:26.240
Well, here's the spot we 
landed in last time. It'll do

0:33:26.240,0:33:30.960
like to pull up just a little more.

0:33:30.960,0:33:38.480
Can we

0:33:38.480,0:33:42.080
guess not?

0:33:46.160,0:33:50.880
Hopefully this isn't too deep.

0:33:50.880,0:34:00.960
We have enough room. Not sure 
if we have the weight for it.

0:34:00.960,0:34:10.720
We do need to eat though.

0:34:10.720,0:34:21.200
If a man's wind really suffers,

0:34:21.200,0:34:27.680
take a breath. Relax for a minute.

0:34:27.680,0:34:38.000
There we go. We got our nails. We got 
our ancient wood. We got our fine wood.

0:34:38.000,0:34:44.240
believe we got the entire

0:34:44.240,0:34:49.920
boat.

0:34:49.920,0:34:57.120
One problem is

0:34:57.120,0:35:05.920
we don't have a connection to Haldor. 
Uh the bear is back already. My gosh.

0:35:09.680,0:35:15.840
Is he going to follow us up here?

0:35:15.840,0:35:27.120
So, the howdor connection's not good 
yet, but all is not lost. We will simply

0:35:27.120,0:35:31.920
drop another portal.

0:35:37.200,0:35:52.800
pop back and activate Haldor. And then we'll 
jump through and pick up the travel portal.

0:36:08.160,0:36:20.960
I want to go talk to Palor. I just 
don't have anything to say right now.

0:36:23.600,0:36:33.600
All right, before we do anything else, 
let's find a home for the big boat,

0:36:33.600,0:36:39.440
which means we're probably 
going to have to shuffle.

0:36:39.440,0:36:50.480
Probably keep most of that there.

0:36:50.480,0:37:06.960
That wouldn't be a bad place for 
it. Just get rid of this extra wood.

0:37:06.960,0:37:13.520
Is that 10 or 20? It's 10. We need 40 for the boat

0:37:13.520,0:37:19.120
plus the 40. Yes. And then 
the 10. Yep, that's right.

0:37:22.320,0:37:29.600
Okay. And we can put away this treasure.

0:37:29.600,0:37:34.720
We've got our two travel portals 
we're probably not going to use.

0:37:34.720,0:37:44.160
And we've got a little more 
extra wood than we need. So,

0:37:54.480,0:38:04.000
should be able to make this up. 
There it is. The early axes.

0:38:04.000,0:38:09.600
Oh, we need a curious axe head.

0:38:09.600,0:38:12.320
That's so curious.

0:38:17.200,0:38:20.960
I'm a little excited

0:38:20.960,0:38:27.680
even if we're not able to use.

0:38:27.680,0:38:33.040
Okay, two leather scraps. We should 
be able to come up with that. Let's

0:38:33.040,0:38:41.440
just grab them all for now and go to upgrade.

0:38:44.480,0:38:50.080
And let's upgrade him again.

0:38:50.080,0:38:57.440
Now we need

0:38:57.440,0:39:08.000
a little more.

0:39:08.000,0:39:10.240
So fully upgraded.

0:39:11.840,0:39:15.760
Now we're at max quality.

0:39:15.760,0:39:25.600
Fully upgraded. The early axles have 325 
durability. And if we compare that to oh

0:39:25.600,0:39:39.920
our iron, it's better. It's better than our 
irons durability. That's kind of amazing. Um

0:39:39.920,0:39:45.760
We can repair it at a level one 
workbench. That's fantastic. So,

0:39:45.760,0:39:51.520
you could do it anywhere you 
can put a roof over a workbench.

0:39:51.520,0:39:59.680
On our slash, we're currently doing 16 
to 29. If we were using our iron axe,

0:39:59.680,0:40:05.840
significantly more at 24 to 45. 
And that's not I mean that's to

0:40:05.840,0:40:17.760
be expected but 16 to 29 that is well 
one I don't know of a slashing weapon

0:40:17.760,0:40:25.920
that exists for maybe the flint knife.

0:40:25.920,0:40:33.280
Uh let's compare it to the flint 
knife. That'd be the closest.

0:40:33.280,0:40:56.320
Flint axis is slash. So, I 
think we have a flint axe.

0:40:56.320,0:41:01.760
That's a stone axe.

0:41:01.760,0:41:13.760
The bronze axe at level three is about the 
same. 17 to 32 versus 16 of 29. That's That's

0:41:13.760,0:41:24.960
outstanding. That's close to the same kind 
of performance we get out of a bronze axe.

0:41:24.960,0:41:28.560
And anything else that we would have

0:41:28.560,0:41:43.680
uh would be the flint axe 10 to 19 16 to 29 
considerably better. Really nice upgrade.

0:41:43.680,0:41:49.600
Let's go give it a try.

0:42:20.240,0:42:28.720
I just I really like the looks 
of that two-handed attack stance.

0:42:31.280,0:42:44.720
We'll have to find something 
to fight. But first, let's

0:42:44.720,0:42:54.000
Oh, I like that. Uh alternate attack move.

0:43:08.640,0:43:21.440
All right. Now, we're going to have 
to find something to try this out on.

0:43:23.280,0:43:27.760
is uh this feels

0:43:27.760,0:43:40.640
movement speed is minus 5%. 
So that's about the same.

0:43:40.640,0:43:44.240
Wow.

0:43:44.240,0:43:48.000
It's kind of fun.

0:43:51.280,0:44:06.000
Uh, something besides a gray lane. Think we 
can sneak up on the deer? I bet we can't.

0:44:06.000,0:44:11.440
I can't get through there.

0:44:11.440,0:44:16.720
He's still there. So, let's see what we can do.

0:44:24.800,0:44:30.800
There he goes. I was afraid of that.

0:44:30.800,0:44:42.080
But we've improved our sneak 
quite a bit at two points. Let's

0:44:42.080,0:44:50.960
I'd be really upset if this 
uh contained the axe head,

0:44:50.960,0:45:03.680
but it doesn't even have a chest 
in it, so we're we're okay.

0:45:08.560,0:45:18.160
Let him get away.

0:45:18.160,0:45:27.600
That was punching. Not the axe. There's the axe.

0:45:47.120,0:45:58.720
the arena. What a great place to 
test it out. Oh man, that popped.

0:45:58.720,0:46:03.200
Let's see.

0:46:10.560,0:46:19.200
effective.

0:46:19.200,0:46:30.560
Oh no. Archers, come on.

0:46:34.320,0:46:44.160
Jeez, that is kind of fun.

0:46:44.160,0:46:59.680
No archers. I do believe we broke the door.

0:46:59.680,0:47:03.280
All right. Real quick, let's 
get a door on here. Repair. Oh,

0:47:03.280,0:47:10.720
we don't have a crafting station handy.

0:47:10.720,0:47:23.520
Now we can repair and put another door 
on there. Go away. You're bothering me.

0:47:34.080,0:47:41.520
It is fun.

0:47:41.520,0:47:46.480
There we go.

0:47:46.480,0:47:50.160
Let's move on.

0:48:01.120,0:48:06.240
probably should head back to West Shore. 
And that's not marked on our map. That's

0:48:06.240,0:48:14.720
uh that's so typical of me.

0:48:37.920,0:48:44.320
We got a brute. Let's see how that

0:48:44.320,0:48:55.520
Oh, that was u It wasn't bad. It went well. We 
got a good stagger out of our parry and we're

0:48:55.520,0:49:05.600
full up. Let's dump that. And we don't really want 
that. So, what else do we got lying around here?

0:49:09.280,0:49:29.680
Where is our house? Is that it over 
there? That looks like the wrong one.

0:49:29.680,0:49:34.160
I could become quite fond of these axes.

0:49:35.360,0:49:48.880
They need to come out with a uh a second tier 
of them. The next tier that I know of isn't

0:49:48.880,0:50:03.040
doesn't become available until

0:50:03.040,0:50:07.040
it's brutal.

0:50:07.040,0:50:32.560
All right, where are we? 
And we need to go this way.

0:51:09.600,0:51:26.240
There we go. There's our giant boat.

0:51:26.240,0:51:31.040
And there's our lovely little cottage.

0:51:33.920,0:51:40.960
So, I wish they would come up with a uh

0:51:40.960,0:51:47.840
oh, maybe a swamp level or mountains level upgrade

0:51:47.840,0:51:54.560
because those are fun. I like those.

0:51:54.560,0:52:02.400
All right, ladies, gentlemen's exiles all

0:52:02.400,0:52:10.640
the me this cold, the hard this worm. 
I'm Grandpa Bud. We've been playing

0:52:10.640,0:52:23.120
Valheim and now we have the early 
axis. Next time we continue with

0:52:23.120,0:52:26.000
what will we continue with? We will continue with

0:52:26.000,0:52:33.840
stealing the frost tears 
from the mountain islands.

0:52:33.840,0:52:37.200
You all have a good one. Thanks for joining.
