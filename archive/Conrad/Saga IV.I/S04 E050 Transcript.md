## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.
 
0:00:16.320,0:00:27.280
The meat is cold, the earth is warm, and the saga 
continues. I'm Grandpa, and we're playing Valheim.

0:00:27.280,0:00:37.680
Now listen close, exiles. We've walked every 
inch of the great green on our home continental.

0:00:37.680,0:00:47.600
We fought through two echoes of the past and 
found the curious axe head twice over. But the

0:00:47.600,0:00:58.160
location of the other remains mysterious. One 
of the Norns are keeping us. one the Norns are

0:00:58.160,0:01:07.360
keeping from us. It is a pier and my boots are 
wearing thin. So today we're leaving Othalagarth

0:01:07.360,0:01:15.520
behind. We're taking our search across the whale 
road to the east. We need to find the final relic

0:01:15.520,0:01:24.160
to finish our set. And if it means crossing the 
deep water and finding a new patch of meadows,

0:01:24.160,0:01:41.680
then that's what we'll do. Let's see what 
this new land has in store for this old man.

0:01:41.680,0:01:52.000
And with that, let's get some sleep. 
I can quit uh sneaking about. Now,

0:01:52.000,0:01:54.960
we're still wearing our heavy armor from the

0:01:56.160,0:02:07.440
last bite. And uh let's switch out 
back to our lighter, more agile

0:02:07.440,0:02:22.880
control height.

0:02:22.880,0:02:34.080
This way we can move faster, 
further on less stamina.

0:02:34.080,0:02:42.240
Make sure we remembered Astard's rule.

0:02:42.240,0:02:52.480
Not leave home without repairs, a full 
belly, and checking our inventory.

0:02:52.480,0:02:58.640
It looks like we're good to go. We really 
don't need I don't know that we got a spot

0:02:58.640,0:03:04.720
to set it down, though. We don't need that 
giant hammer. We just aren't using it that

0:03:04.720,0:03:13.120
often. Not for this search anyway. That'll 
just free up another inventory slot for us.

0:03:15.280,0:03:22.640
So, if you recall, we've been searching this 
new land that's a little across the sea from

0:03:22.640,0:03:32.160
where we were. So, we sailed out of West 
Shore and across this waters through this

0:03:32.160,0:03:42.080
uh new column, and we're going 
to continue to see if we can't

0:03:43.040,0:03:55.280
Clear all of the great green over here. With 
that, let's put this in our pocket and head out.

0:03:55.280,0:04:03.040
Well, there we go. Have to have our 
hammer out if we're going to do that.

0:04:06.080,0:04:13.680
So, we're right on the base of these 
mountains, and we're just going to keep

0:04:13.680,0:04:25.920
trying to fill in this missing area. So, 
let's head pretty much north by northeast.

0:04:25.920,0:04:32.640
Let's go ahead and eat a sausage or uh

0:04:32.640,0:04:42.800
hitting low. We're down below 
100 points of health. So So

0:04:42.800,0:04:48.240
there's the next black forest, it looks like.

0:04:48.240,0:05:00.800
And more mountains.

0:05:00.800,0:05:16.640
And it looks like we've got an A-frame 
right here that we haven't dealt with yet.

0:05:16.640,0:05:25.040
But no chest in it. Let's mark it off our map.

0:05:25.040,0:05:28.400
We're getting a few of these.

0:05:30.560,0:05:38.160
Hopefully there won't be too many more.

0:05:38.160,0:05:48.240
I think we'll follow the uh black forest

0:05:48.240,0:05:55.200
and then we'll circle back and 
fill in the area in between.

0:06:20.400,0:06:22.800
Looking back some over some of the old videos,

0:06:22.800,0:06:28.960
I noticed I just walked right 
past houses in the past.

0:06:30.480,0:06:40.400
I guess I was looking one direction 
and should have been looking the other.

0:06:40.400,0:07:00.880
So, I want to try to be 
careful not to do that again.

0:07:00.880,0:07:06.640
Not an A-frame, but we'll check it anyway.

0:07:12.800,0:07:30.640
No chest.

0:08:53.840,0:09:05.680
I don't remember if we knew 
there was a swamp here.

0:09:05.680,0:09:36.080
But there is Let's see. No, we didn't 
have it on our map prior to this.

0:10:21.840,0:10:33.120
You're okay.

0:10:33.120,0:10:38.160
Let the bacon run out. 
That's dangerous thing to do.

0:11:04.640,0:11:28.240
Those

0:11:28.240,0:11:32.400
statues in the swamp are kind of creepy.

0:11:36.560,0:11:56.800
They gave this old man the willies.

0:12:12.400,0:12:18.400
Can't decide if we need to go down 
there. I think we're going to pass.

0:12:21.040,0:12:38.320
We can see can see everything 
without making the descent.

0:12:38.320,0:12:44.880
That's interesting.

0:12:44.880,0:12:50.480
You've got this gut tree. firmly in the meadows,

0:12:50.480,0:13:00.960
which is rare. And as long as the guck 
is hanging down this low, let's grab it.

0:13:00.960,0:13:16.720
That's essential to a few 
recipes that we'll need later.

0:13:19.280,0:13:21.680
And this structure is usually only found in the

0:13:21.680,0:13:30.960
swamp. And since it's here on the edge 
of the swamp, I guess it qualifies, but

0:13:30.960,0:13:45.520
it's actually in the meadows. Well, we're 
not going to get across there. I see a bed.

0:13:46.080,0:13:54.800
Let's uh put down a crafting table

0:13:54.800,0:14:08.240
and take a look at u putting the 
floor in there so we can get across.

0:14:08.240,0:14:16.400
Just some quick repairs because I don't know why.

0:14:16.400,0:14:29.760
Let's drop a floor right here. Well, 
we can just get by with the halves.

0:14:29.760,0:14:33.760
And there's a Drew guy taking an interest in him.

0:14:33.760,0:14:47.440
He can't get up here. So, not too much to 
be concerned with till we decide to go down.

0:14:47.440,0:14:56.240
Yeah, I had a feeling that would 
happen. Let's say hi to this guy.

0:15:00.320,0:15:13.520
Always try to land that shield barrier when 
you can. Makes your life so much easier.

0:15:13.520,0:15:19.920
All right. Can we get that? Let's see 
if that went in the right place. It

0:15:19.920,0:15:47.840
looks like it did. All that and 
no chest. So there we have it.

0:15:54.560,0:16:06.000
Do we need to pick that up?

0:16:06.000,0:16:11.200
Let's check and see.

0:16:11.200,0:16:15.680
29. It wouldn't hurt.

0:16:15.680,0:16:17.120
We'll take it with us.

0:16:26.640,0:16:45.280
This must be close to where we landed.

0:17:21.920,0:17:41.680
There we're starting to close the circle now. 
Getting back close to where we landed the boat.

0:18:12.320,0:18:36.800
Well, we fused up our rested buff.

0:18:47.600,0:18:56.400
Let's check out this runstone. See if it's 
anything new or a repeat of past memories. Where

0:18:56.400,0:19:04.800
the grass grows underfoot and the sky is blue 
overhead. There will always be a earth and a home.

0:19:04.800,0:19:12.400
Earth or hearth. I know it's hearth and I keep 
saying earth. The ea sound just makes me think

0:19:12.400,0:19:25.680
it's supposed to be earth. I might have to uh look 
that one up in my pumpkin wagon. See what it says.

0:19:25.680,0:19:33.680
Well, this is not an A frame, nor is 
it even a house. And it doesn't have a

0:19:33.680,0:19:41.040
doesn't even have a

0:19:41.040,0:19:56.880
guess. We don't have any room left for mushrooms. 
Doesn't even have a treasure chest in it.

0:19:56.880,0:19:58.160
My

0:20:27.440,0:20:43.600
He's in the general direction 
we need to go. Pretty

0:20:43.600,0:20:46.880
sure we checked that building 
when we first arrived,

0:20:46.880,0:20:59.360
but didn't mark it off on the map. 
So, we're going to do that now

0:20:59.360,0:21:05.040
and then we're probably going to uh

0:21:05.040,0:21:10.160
take a minute to admire that sunset

0:21:10.160,0:21:15.680
and the great tree.

0:21:23.760,0:21:36.000
All right.

0:21:36.000,0:21:43.840
Drop our crafting table

0:21:43.840,0:21:44.960
and our portal.

0:21:47.680,0:22:09.520
and we'll head home to Thala 
for a good night's rest.

0:22:22.480,0:22:28.160
Throw a lock on the fire.

0:22:28.160,0:22:36.960
And uh that's put in the slow. We might want 
to pick up a few sticks while we're out.

0:23:08.960,0:23:17.920
How much wood we need for the 
small boat? I don't think it's 40.

0:23:17.920,0:23:26.320
Yeah, it's only 30. We stacked up some extra.

0:23:26.320,0:23:40.080
So, it only takes 30 fine wood for the 
small boat. And when it comes to skins,

0:23:40.080,0:23:47.120
we need 10. So, we're throwing 
some extra stuff in here.

0:23:51.120,0:24:00.320
And we need 20 resin. So, let's move 
this stuff where it belongs. Finish

0:24:00.320,0:24:13.040
out that stack and start a new one for fine wood.

0:24:13.040,0:24:15.440
That's more like it.

0:24:20.080,0:24:30.320
So, I've been using AI to help me, trying to 
improve the overall quality and add some lore

0:24:30.320,0:24:37.200
to try to make it a little bit more interesting 
on these live streams. And it keeps complaining

0:24:37.200,0:24:52.640
to me about how much time I spend on inventory 
control. And I've got to agree with it. Uh but

0:24:52.640,0:24:57.840
I'm not sure outside of a mod and I tend to play

0:24:57.840,0:25:09.840
mod free. I'm beginning to wonder 
if I want to continue to do that.

0:25:09.840,0:25:13.360
No, we took the crafting table 
down first. That was the problem.

0:25:19.840,0:25:26.880
Now we can put that portal in our pocket and 
put the crafting table in our pocket and we'll

0:25:26.880,0:25:41.520
continue our search. Let's just double back 
this way and expand out on what we uh where

0:25:41.520,0:25:48.960
we found the edge of the black forest. Oh, one 
thing we meant to do and we didn't do while we

0:25:48.960,0:25:57.680
were there. Well, one, we're not following 
Astrid's rule and keeping our belly full.

0:26:01.840,0:26:14.480
But we wanted to mark that building as done.

0:26:14.480,0:26:23.440
There we go. Now, let's run over to this 
building and mark it as done as well. Or

0:26:23.440,0:26:30.480
at least I keep seeing a building over here. I'm 
not sure there is. Or is it just the peak? Yeah,

0:26:30.480,0:26:52.160
it looks like it's just that hilltop. That 
hilltop peak looks just like a building.

0:27:02.640,0:27:15.760
We do really need to make uh a 
run of iron up to the thala base

0:27:15.760,0:27:19.360
and build those.

0:27:39.200,0:27:45.840
those iron chests because they 
give us so much more room.

0:27:45.840,0:27:55.360
Here's

0:27:55.360,0:28:03.840
an egg frame we didn't have 
marked. And it has a chest.

0:28:03.840,0:28:10.560
And it's not the chest we wanted.

0:28:17.840,0:28:36.800
So, let's keep going north. No, south. Let's 
keep going south. We'll fill this gap right here.

0:29:28.080,0:29:34.240
I got to think we must have walked 
past one or two A-frames that had

0:29:34.240,0:29:44.640
the axe heads in it and we just didn't see them.

0:29:44.640,0:29:50.960
Which is dense as the forest gets. 
It wouldn't be that hard to do

0:29:50.960,0:29:54.800
even in the meadows.

0:29:54.800,0:30:00.720
All right, we need another 
bite of sausage, it looks like.

0:30:38.160,0:30:40.160
I don't know if that's what we're looking

0:30:51.280,0:31:00.880
No, it isn't because there is nothing in it.

0:31:07.360,0:31:15.120
Might be time to get the boat pretty 
soon. Do a little more sailing.

0:31:15.120,0:31:20.000
I'm extremely disappointed.

0:31:20.000,0:31:29.200
I'd really hope that we'd be able to close 
this quest out in two, three episodes.

0:31:35.040,0:31:40.000
But now that I've started,

0:31:40.000,0:31:45.680
I find it very hard to admit defeat.

0:31:45.680,0:31:50.240
Did we read this one last time?

0:31:50.240,0:31:57.280
This land is hard and wild, but we who 
brought are brought here are harder still.

0:31:58.400,0:32:10.640
We can get rid of this guy.

0:32:10.640,0:32:15.120
That's the typical bore runstone. I don't think we

0:32:15.120,0:32:22.320
uh pretty sure we've read that 
one once or twice already.

0:32:24.880,0:32:30.480
Now, here's one that we didn't mark.

0:32:30.480,0:32:48.560
It looks promising, but no chest. Oh.

0:33:09.360,0:33:14.320
Well, that closes out that section.

0:33:14.320,0:33:22.960
Let's double back this direction. west

0:33:22.960,0:33:39.680
and cover this southwest section.

0:33:39.680,0:33:45.040
That's the echoes of the 
past that we fought before.

0:33:52.880,0:34:08.400
Got another beehive there.

0:34:08.400,0:34:14.240
Don't know that we uh need another 
queen, but we've got one now.

0:34:24.640,0:34:34.960
Okay, looks like we're going to be heading west 
by northwest now. Just filling in those gaps,

0:34:34.960,0:34:40.880
trying to see if there's any 
buildings we didn't spot before.

0:35:09.200,0:35:15.840
I think we hit that building last time.

0:35:15.840,0:35:24.480
Another

0:35:24.480,0:35:27.760
runstone.

0:35:27.760,0:35:36.720
Pause. Traveler. You are w You are welcome. 
You are welcome to the last and most lawless

0:35:36.720,0:35:43.840
of the 10 worlds in Valheim. The air is 
pure. The water deep and clear and the

0:35:43.840,0:36:08.240
forest overflowing with bounty. Here is 
adventure, joy, and glory for the taking.

0:36:23.040,0:36:34.160
So, we close out that section and then this 
little gap right here is all we have left.

0:36:42.320,0:37:01.680
And we are done.

0:37:17.520,0:37:26.800
Dear me, it's what I wanted. 
What can I get rid of? Not much.

0:37:26.800,0:37:30.160
Well, we're going to jump back and grab

0:37:35.760,0:37:53.040
come right back for you. We're going 
to jump back and grab the portal.

0:37:53.040,0:37:59.280
Not the portal. We're going to 
use the portal to grab the boat.

0:38:13.040,0:38:25.280
And now that we dropped a portal, we can go back 
and pick up that deer meat that we left behind.

0:38:46.800,0:38:54.480
We should go step into the sunlight and see 
what the heavens can tell us about the day.

0:38:57.760,0:39:05.520
Well, not a lot left.

0:39:05.520,0:39:23.920
We've got a good crop of turnups to harvest.

0:39:38.160,0:39:46.080
I don't know if I've ever had this many bees.

0:39:51.680,0:40:05.920
Let's go ahead and refill 
our bacon while we're here.

0:40:05.920,0:40:10.560
And I did want to pick up just a

0:40:10.560,0:40:13.840
sliver more wood.

0:40:20.000,0:40:32.400
One, two, three, four, five, six, 7,000 gold.

0:40:32.400,0:40:36.880
That's a pretty good hall for being

0:40:36.880,0:40:40.800
where we are in our journey.

0:41:25.040,0:41:30.240
Going to jump out the west shore for a minute.

0:41:30.240,0:41:35.760
A little bit too quickly though, I think.

0:41:35.760,0:41:39.520
There's a couple of things 
I want to get take with us.

0:41:48.960,0:42:07.440
Oh, we got those. And I just 
wanted uh the rest of that

0:42:21.600,0:42:29.520
There's all those uh birch trees we planted.

0:42:29.520,0:42:35.120
Now, let's see if we can do this 
without uh too much trouble.

0:42:38.560,0:42:55.760
and welcome to the area called Westshore, known 
because it is west of our home base, Othala.

0:42:57.440,0:43:09.680
Curious thing about Othala, I named 
it after some of the Norse spellings

0:43:09.680,0:43:16.000
and Norse words, Norse mythology.

0:43:16.000,0:43:25.200
But it really hit home because it's 
so close to the name of my hometown

0:43:25.200,0:43:39.920
which is tha and tha meant beautiful land in 
the land uh language I believe of the Shaune.

0:43:39.920,0:43:44.960
So, Othala seemed like a great

0:43:44.960,0:43:50.080
name for our homeland here. All right,

0:43:50.080,0:43:58.080
we're going to drop a wood pole. 
2 mters. Uh, we need a workbench.

0:43:58.080,0:44:02.000
Typically, we don't have a workbench out 
here because we don't want this to be cons

0:44:02.000,0:44:11.920
our time here to be considered as on a base. 
call going to trigger a raid is what we're

0:44:11.920,0:44:20.560
trying to avoid. That's why we moved our 
this to be our agricultural center. Now,

0:44:20.560,0:44:29.040
we're going to build one of those beehives 
with our all those queens we've gathered.

0:44:30.480,0:44:36.480
I don't know if I can get it done

0:44:36.480,0:44:47.680
before the sun sets on me though.

0:44:47.680,0:44:53.040
Or if I brought enough wood.

0:44:53.040,0:45:06.000
That looks about right. So,

0:45:06.000,0:45:14.320
I mean, we have the bees. We might as well. What 
am I missing? I'm missing wood. All right. Well,

0:45:14.320,0:45:19.840
we're going to tear this down because 
we don't want to leave it behind.

0:45:19.840,0:45:29.520
and then we'll have to come back 
another time to finish this out.

0:45:29.520,0:45:45.120
Let's head on back.

0:45:45.120,0:45:48.160
Let's head back and get some sleep.

0:45:52.480,0:45:58.880
Can't decide right now if I want to use the boat.

0:45:58.880,0:46:06.880
I think I do rather than on 
foot. I think we'll take the boat

0:46:06.880,0:46:17.520
across the whale away whale ways whale 
road anyway to the new lands to the east.

0:46:17.520,0:46:29.440
Take the boat over there 
and sail around that aisle

0:46:29.440,0:46:35.440
to see if we can find any 
more meadows on this land

0:46:35.440,0:46:44.160
because once again we've exhausted what we had.

0:46:44.160,0:46:57.840
We're missing 10 Dear hide, where did we?

0:46:57.840,0:47:08.000
We're going to face Astrid's 
wrath for not following our rules.

0:47:08.000,0:47:11.680
Okay, we need seven of these.

0:47:13.200,0:47:33.200
I think I took 10 when I 
meant to leave him. Anyway,

0:47:33.200,0:47:39.120
let's try this again. There we go.

0:47:45.120,0:47:55.520
Put the portal in our pocket and the crafting 
table. Let's jump in the boat after we eat.

0:47:55.520,0:48:06.320
Need more bacon. Always need more bacon. Oh, 
I should have checked the rudder location.

0:48:07.600,0:48:16.000
I hate having to back out.

0:48:16.000,0:48:20.160
I think we'll go

0:48:20.160,0:48:34.240
south from here.

0:48:49.200,0:49:02.720
Let's see what lies on the 
other side of that black forest.

0:49:08.000,0:49:15.760
Well, there's the black 
forest. See it plainly enough.

0:49:15.760,0:49:26.560
Let's zoom out so we can see what we're doing 
here. The sails get in the way so easily.

0:49:31.040,0:49:40.800
I just hope it's not all planes,

0:49:40.800,0:49:47.920
but we're not that far

0:49:47.920,0:49:53.920
from the start. We shouldn't 
be finding more meadows.

0:49:58.080,0:50:19.600
More swamp. That's interesting.

0:50:19.600,0:50:35.840
Not what I was hoping for. Was hoping there'd 
just be a nice little spot of black forest.

0:50:35.840,0:50:55.520
And then some more of the great green.

0:51:43.520,0:51:57.440
Well, I see Meadows like land

0:51:57.440,0:52:01.920
and more black forest.

0:52:05.360,0:52:24.560
and what appears to be an A-frame.

0:52:24.560,0:52:29.920
So, let's drop anchor right about here

0:52:29.920,0:52:43.520
and we'll see what we can find out.

0:52:43.520,0:52:52.080
First thing first, we put up our portal

0:52:52.080,0:52:53.520
crafting table.

0:52:58.560,0:53:09.520
and portal. Now, let's check out the safe frame.

0:53:09.520,0:53:20.240
Dear, nothing. No chest, no door, nothing.

0:53:27.840,0:53:33.360
But it's a start. We have meadows.

0:53:33.360,0:53:45.840
We have more area to discover.

0:53:45.840,0:53:48.960
Let's grab our boat. Take it back.

0:54:01.120,0:54:10.960
and make sure we got enough stamina.

0:54:10.960,0:54:15.600
Looks like we got all four pieces.

0:54:23.680,0:54:42.240
Let's uh return the favor on this graining here.

0:54:42.240,0:54:42.740
All

0:54:50.080,0:54:57.920
right.

0:54:57.920,0:55:03.280
One thing we haven't been doing 
that I typically do is establish

0:55:03.280,0:55:11.360
a base on the land where we put a portal down.

0:55:16.080,0:55:22.880
That portal serves as an anchor on that land 
in case we were to die without having put

0:55:22.880,0:55:31.680
down our travel portal. And uh we should 
probably be following that rule out here,

0:55:31.680,0:55:40.160
especially now that we're between the swamp 
and land and who knows what else. Okay,

0:55:40.160,0:55:49.840
put the boat away. And then we're going 
to grab a little bit of wood and quickly,

0:55:49.840,0:55:54.480
finish off

0:55:54.480,0:55:59.040
that beehive that we started.

0:55:59.040,0:56:02.880
I like that bee

0:56:02.880,0:56:06.480
hive pattern.

0:56:12.080,0:56:15.840
Because it's so easy just to grab the 
honey. You just run around underneath it,

0:56:15.840,0:56:23.360
grab the honey, falls down to you,

0:56:23.360,0:56:30.800
unless of course it gets stuck on 
top, which is always a pain. Okay,

0:56:30.800,0:56:35.840
here we go. One of these days we're 
going to have to put in the bridge.

0:56:38.000,0:56:42.880
Right now, we're just doing these beehives.

0:56:42.880,0:56:50.560
Now, I should have moved it a little further 
away so it wasn't on this hillside. Uh,

0:56:50.560,0:56:59.440
if you recall from earlier 
videos, we were jumping around.

0:56:59.440,0:57:04.960
All right, let's put down our 
workbench. Temporary workbench.

0:57:08.160,0:57:31.280
And then we'll just hang these 
beees hives right off of these arms.

0:57:31.280,0:57:40.320
So you get eight beehives all in one. small area

0:57:40.320,0:57:49.120
and we need just a little more wood.

0:57:49.120,0:57:59.680
Don't suppose we left any behind.

0:57:59.680,0:58:03.360
I'm going to consider that left 
behind just for our purposes.

0:58:05.440,0:58:13.120
I'm sure that was the intent 
when we left it there.

0:58:13.120,0:58:22.160
Now, there we go. And all your bees are happy. Oh, 
they even add some honey. But that's that's the

0:58:22.160,0:58:52.240
uh problem. And that's why we use a short pole 
so we can jump get the honey. But there it is.

0:58:52.240,0:58:56.240
Yep, they're all happy.

0:58:56.240,0:59:00.240
We have our hoe with us. Let's see what we can do.

0:59:11.840,0:59:23.920
Just level that ground out a little bit. 
Now, let's get rid of this workbench.

0:59:23.920,0:59:28.960
So, hopefully this area then isn't raid eligible.

0:59:39.200,0:59:45.440
And that's the ramp up in case we fall in the pit.

0:59:45.440,0:59:53.840
There we go. That's the beehive.

0:59:53.840,0:59:57.440
Gota thanks for that roof design. I like that.

0:59:58.080,1:00:05.040
Um, check out his uh efficient story 
videos and some of his building videos.

1:00:05.040,1:00:13.040
They're really quite good. Going to grab 
half of this for our travel wood. And we

1:00:13.040,1:00:25.600
still have five bees left over. And I'm sure by 
the time we're done, we're going to have more.

1:00:25.600,1:00:32.720
I'll look to put uh's links 
in this video description

1:00:32.720,1:00:49.440
in case you're interested in checking him out.

1:01:10.880,1:01:17.680
All right, let's grab some portal 
materials so we establish a base

1:01:17.680,1:01:26.000
portal. We'll just drop it in the 
building right there on the shore.

1:01:33.600,1:01:39.920
I think the only thing left is we need 10 eyes.

1:01:39.920,1:01:50.080
Now, let's double check that we can build a 
portal. Looks like we got everything we need.

1:01:50.080,1:01:55.120
So, put the hammer away. Let's head back.

1:01:59.920,1:02:06.240
One step ahead of myself.

1:02:06.240,1:02:16.960
We'll leave that right there. We said we're 
going to put it in here. And let's do that.

1:02:16.960,1:02:24.000
Let's touch this place up real quick. 
Uh we're going to need a crafting table.

1:02:29.200,1:02:34.400
I need to do some repairs. Just

1:02:34.400,1:02:47.840
want our place to look nice. I wonder if I 
can do a Don't like the grass growing inside.

1:02:53.360,1:03:09.360
Maybe if I do this around the edges.

1:03:09.360,1:03:10.880
Otherwise, I'm going to have to pull the

1:03:10.880,1:03:16.800
floorboards up just to clear 
the grass. Oh, that worked.

1:03:46.320,1:04:00.640
Drop. Drop in a couple of roof panels.

1:04:00.640,1:04:08.000
Couple more repairs it looks like. There we go.

1:04:08.000,1:04:15.360
And a door.

1:04:16.320,1:04:20.560
There we go.

1:04:20.560,1:04:44.000
Let's move this guy. Let's save that big space for 
the portal. He'll fit right here rather nicely.

1:05:02.160,1:05:10.560
Don't have a good name for this portal.

1:05:10.560,1:05:13.120
For now, we'll just go with green shore.

1:05:18.800,1:05:21.360
So, that's our anchor portal. Now,

1:05:21.360,1:05:35.280
we just need to bop back home and anchor it. 
And then we can pick up our travel portal.

1:05:35.280,1:05:42.480
Ah, got to add it to our map. Always 
want to have those locations mapped.

1:05:48.720,1:05:53.920
Because if you uh leave for a period of time,

1:05:53.920,1:06:07.600
unless your memory is much better than mine, you 
tend to forget what these portal names are. So,

1:06:07.600,1:06:11.600
we're going to convert that 
from a nothing here building.

1:06:12.640,1:06:23.600
to a portal building or a portal icon 
with the name of the portal on it.

1:06:23.600,1:06:39.920
Then we can always just reference 
our map for how do we get back here.

1:06:55.200,1:07:00.320
Looks like we're all set.

1:07:00.320,1:07:04.400
No need to get rid of that because 
we'll just get more. Going to have

1:07:04.400,1:07:08.640
to take a short break and I will be right back.

1:08:24.800,1:08:34.960
All right, let's get some sleep.

1:08:34.960,1:08:47.840
I believe after we find the last X head, we're 
going to go in search of Hor, the vendor.

1:08:48.960,1:08:57.280
I just really

1:08:57.280,1:09:11.600
want to find him and be able to put some of 
that treasure that we have found to good use.

1:09:15.360,1:09:21.200
So, we'll put the portal in our pocket, 
put the crafting table in our pocket,

1:09:21.200,1:09:34.480
and continue our search. Head back 
towards these swamp lands over here.

1:09:34.480,1:09:39.440
Those

1:09:39.440,1:09:59.280
creatures are more of a nuisance 
now than they are anything.

1:10:11.360,1:10:21.360
We didn't follow Astrid's rules, did we?

1:10:39.440,1:10:46.080
Well, let's mark it off the map.

1:11:09.120,1:11:15.600
I could make a lot more progress if 
I just turn the uh world settings to

1:11:15.600,1:11:28.240
have the creatures not attack us. But I can 
never do that kind of thing. It just always feels

1:11:28.240,1:11:41.040
like I'm cheating the game.

1:11:47.440,1:11:55.760
Yeah, we're not alone. I can hear the 
skeletons or somebody in the It's got

1:11:55.760,1:12:02.800
to be skeletons. Nice little copper deposit here.

1:12:02.800,1:12:08.320
The forest's marrow.

1:12:44.720,1:12:55.680
have to read that later.

1:12:55.680,1:12:57.360
Come on.

1:13:04.080,1:13:18.480
All right. Wolf had something 
to say. Let's see what it was.

1:13:18.480,1:13:25.680
Yes, we've read Off saying this 
one. And we pray for you, Ol.

1:13:28.160,1:13:47.440
We pray that our fate is not the same as yours.

1:14:43.120,1:14:50.800
believe that uh

1:14:50.800,1:15:06.880
yep, we've got a blue ghost on us, I 
suppose. Nothing to do but deal with it.

1:15:15.840,1:15:19.840
A well timed parry

1:15:19.840,1:15:24.640
or welltimed dodge roll,

1:15:24.640,1:15:31.680
but especially a welltimed parry.

1:15:40.880,1:15:52.720
Not that we need the trophy, 
but let's pick it up anyway.

1:15:52.720,1:15:58.640
Still early morning.

1:15:58.640,1:16:08.960
Blueeyed shufflers in muck. The neck are 
small lizard native to Valheim. Surly and

1:16:08.960,1:16:16.720
meanspirited spirited. They will attack on sight 
and must be destroyed like vermin. They stay near

1:16:16.720,1:16:24.080
water because the creature of the land loathe 
and uphore them. Yet no creature is all bad.

1:16:24.080,1:16:52.480
Their tales are delicious. And I do believe we've 
read that one before, but I still like the ending.

1:16:52.480,1:16:54.720
Somehow

1:16:58.000,1:17:03.760
We're practically back to where we started.

1:17:03.760,1:17:19.280
Got not much to show for it.

1:17:19.280,1:17:22.000
Oh.

1:17:25.280,1:17:33.680
That's too bad. Very small section 
of meadows. Going to try to run that

1:17:33.680,1:17:50.400
again real quick just to see that we 
got it right, but I'm afraid we did.

1:18:40.240,1:18:50.000
Speaker's power is excellent when you want to run.

1:18:50.000,1:18:57.600
Get up from behind that tree.

1:18:57.600,1:19:05.680
Yeah, looks like we covered it pretty 
well and there's just not much there.

1:19:11.360,1:19:25.040
Run back down the middle one. Doesn't look 
like we missed anything. Did we get that one?

1:19:25.040,1:19:33.760
Wow. Nice jump. Well, we didn't get it, 
but it doesn't have what we want either.

1:19:36.080,1:19:56.560
So easy to miss one.

1:19:56.560,1:20:00.720
Yeah, we did get that one.

1:20:07.840,1:20:17.600
Sorry about that. I think I bumped the microphone.

1:20:17.600,1:20:47.280
Oh, the deer have taken to our roof. Looks like

1:20:47.280,1:20:50.000
let's head back and

1:20:52.240,1:21:13.600
sort out our findings.

1:21:13.600,1:21:19.680
Yeah. Let's see. This is where we've 
got to be careful cuz we'll dump those

1:21:19.680,1:21:25.920
portal items that we need.

1:21:25.920,1:21:30.640
and

1:21:30.640,1:21:49.680
got this whole stack of blue skin.

1:22:12.560,1:22:16.800
Going to move that table over here.

1:22:19.440,1:22:29.040
want to keep it fairly close because 
I want it uh bonus to our rested buff.

1:22:29.040,1:22:36.080
But we have another chest

1:22:36.080,1:22:44.000
which we're in dire need of 
because these seem to be filling.

1:23:44.000,1:23:54.320
Think

1:23:54.320,1:24:03.600
we're going to go sailing again.

1:24:03.600,1:24:12.400
And I'm thinking of taking the big boat, but 
I'm not finding it. Where did I place it?

1:24:14.400,1:24:33.040
It's not going to be there. 
It's not going to be there.

1:24:33.040,1:24:38.480
Ah, we did bring that iron with us.

1:24:41.840,1:25:00.960
Interesting.

1:25:42.720,1:25:50.400
So, we're going to start this 
reorg by putting one iron chest

1:25:50.400,1:25:57.520
over here.

1:25:57.520,1:26:04.400
And I wanted to put that keep all 
our metals in the central location.

1:26:04.400,1:26:13.360
Uh we need to put enough for the boat over here. 
Actually, let's just put the the portal. Not the

1:26:13.360,1:26:26.480
boat. Let's put that portal right here for the 
time being. Have to remember to pick it up and

1:26:27.760,1:26:38.160
We should be able to hopefully 
we can open this chest, take all

1:26:38.160,1:26:54.880
and put it all in here. Can immediately 
see how much more room these chests have.

1:26:54.880,1:27:00.560
So, we emptied that chest and we 
didn't even have to fill this one. So,

1:27:00.560,1:27:20.560
what we're going to do is empty this one.

1:27:20.560,1:27:23.440
And now we're going to tear these two down.

1:27:32.400,1:27:36.320
and replace it

1:27:36.320,1:27:51.920
with a couple of iron chests.

1:27:53.520,1:28:04.560
Can't tell what this is doing here. 
There we go. Come on. Right there.

1:28:04.560,1:28:14.720
And now go back to furniture. 
Put an iron chest on top.

1:28:14.720,1:28:25.840
And the spice rack is in the way. So, we're 
going to have to move the spice rack. Let's put

1:28:25.840,1:28:35.120
a beam over here to hang that spice rack on.

1:28:35.120,1:28:42.640
That'll do. And let's tear it down.

1:28:42.640,1:28:46.800
Hopefully, we got it all. And 
let's put it back over here.

1:28:52.320,1:28:58.400
And we'll just hang it from that beam 
right there. Why isn't it hanging? Needs

1:28:58.400,1:29:10.560
to be placed near appropriate crafting 
station. Like I thought that was near.

1:29:10.560,1:29:15.600
Okay, let's see if we can 
get that iron chest up there.

1:29:22.560,1:29:30.480
Now, will the spice rack go?

1:29:30.480,1:29:45.040
Where's that beam that we had it on?

1:29:48.800,1:30:08.480
I can't see anything in the dark. Did we take it 
down? Did we know? There it is. It's right there.

1:30:08.480,1:30:14.160
It won't let us put it there because

1:30:14.160,1:30:26.880
All right, let's see if we can We're gonna 
have enough extra beams hanging around here.

1:30:26.880,1:30:32.880
That beam's the wrong direction. 
I want this direction.

1:30:32.880,1:30:36.160
Let's

1:30:36.160,1:30:54.400
see if we can get it to fit there.

1:30:54.400,1:30:59.200
There we go. But that's what I was afraid of. See,

1:30:59.200,1:31:13.680
now you can't get to the pot. Well, if you 
stand in just the right place, you can.

1:31:13.680,1:31:18.640
It's going to do for now. I 
don't want to mess with it. So,

1:31:18.640,1:31:26.480
let's take all I got most of the veggies.

1:31:43.680,1:31:52.400
And then we got the meat 
and the rest of the veggies.

1:31:59.520,1:32:03.440
Now we've got enough room 
for our overflow. We'll use

1:32:03.440,1:32:15.680
that for swapping these out. Let's 
look at taking our overflow here.

1:32:15.680,1:32:21.440
And we can put this in the chest 
with the rest of the veggies.

1:32:27.360,1:32:49.200
And suddenly we have enough room. We 
have more room. Not enough but more room.

1:33:08.000,1:33:17.440
That's enough for now. We'll keep at this 
and uh but I just don't want to tie up in

1:33:17.440,1:33:25.200
a whole lot of time. So, let's grab the 
boat in the morning. Make sure we've got

1:33:25.200,1:33:33.840
a good full belly and head out on 
another sailing trip. I'm curious

1:33:33.840,1:33:43.520
where I left the big boat. Going to have 
to go search for that one of these days.

1:33:51.600,1:33:59.760
But I'm not finding it.

1:33:59.760,1:34:07.600
I thought we were keeping all that right here.

1:34:16.640,1:34:34.480
But no.

1:34:50.240,1:34:59.680
Let's get the rudder going 
the right direction this time.

1:34:59.680,1:35:02.560
Let's go grab our portal.

1:35:26.000,1:35:32.160
Don't want to trade it for the H. both.

1:35:32.160,1:35:53.200
Make sure we can create a portal and we're good.

1:36:10.640,1:36:19.280
missed it.

1:37:08.320,1:37:24.480
There's got to be some land over 
in here too that we could go visit.

1:37:35.040,1:37:44.080
Shallow water. Didn't see any rocks.

1:37:50.800,1:37:54.640
So, we're just going to keep uh sailing around

1:37:54.640,1:38:05.600
this land to see if we can find all of 
the meadows, search those great greens,

1:38:05.600,1:38:11.200
and see if we can find the 
fifth anniversary prize.

1:38:27.200,1:38:37.760
Looks like that's planes up ahead. That tower 
looks like it's decorated with fueling design.

1:39:05.200,1:39:10.640
I do believe that's a fueling tower.

1:39:10.640,1:39:15.920
And there's our mountain just 
on the other side of the plains.

1:39:35.040,1:39:43.280
And we may be sliding into the serpent's way here.

1:39:43.280,1:39:51.200
Big trollfish. Going

1:39:51.200,1:40:01.280
to keep our distance from the plane so 
that we don't catch that flying death.

1:40:01.280,1:40:09.760
There's a fueling standing out 
there on the shore looking for us.

1:40:34.320,1:40:46.400
Is that a storm blowing in? 
We lost the wind's favor.

1:40:46.400,1:40:48.800
We're down to the power of the ore.

1:41:27.600,1:41:34.000
Yes, that's definitely a storm.

1:42:05.680,1:42:10.640
Then that's a fueling watchtowwer.

1:42:10.640,1:42:15.520
A full fueling village.

1:42:15.520,1:42:20.160
Storm didn't last long.

1:42:29.040,1:42:38.400
And the wind shifted in our favor. 
Should speed the trip along,

1:42:38.400,1:42:45.280
but the rain's come back.

1:42:54.720,1:43:03.840
Maybe we should have brought the big boat.

1:43:03.840,1:43:11.040
Can't make up its mind if it's 
going to storm or be sunny.

1:43:33.040,1:43:39.120
shipwreck along the shore there. 
Go investigate it. But we are not

1:43:39.120,1:43:48.320
we're not dressed for PR planes adventure.

1:43:48.320,1:44:00.320
Looks like the majority of the 
backside of our island is planes.

1:44:00.320,1:44:14.000
Not going to help us much.

1:44:32.720,1:44:43.600
See if we can get in closer to shore 
without getting too much danger.

1:44:43.600,1:44:49.280
Ah, you see those fires?

1:44:49.280,1:44:52.400
That's the fueling bonfires.

1:44:56.080,1:45:01.440
Yeah, at least there's black forest ahead.

1:45:01.440,1:45:10.640
And there's a death ske. We 
don't want any piece of him.

1:45:10.640,1:45:15.840
Not that far.

1:45:20.400,1:45:22.320
Doesn't look like he's going to give chase,

1:45:22.320,1:45:44.640
which is a good thing cuz there's not 
much we could do from inside of a boat

1:45:44.640,1:45:45.140
to

1:45:50.400,1:46:03.840
Well, looks like we're about halfway around. Let's 
avoid that peninsula. I don't want to hit that.

1:46:03.840,1:46:10.560
With a bit of luck, there 
should be some meadows ahead.

1:46:10.560,1:46:25.040
Going

1:46:25.040,1:46:37.520
to try to cut between this narrow spot here, but 
no, let's go around it. Better safe than sorry.

1:46:52.160,1:47:01.040
Looks like some birch ahead, but 
I can't tell if that's going to be

1:47:01.040,1:47:04.720
plains or meadows.

1:47:22.720,1:47:29.200
I think it best that we uh

1:47:29.200,1:47:37.440
drop anchor on the shoreline here and

1:47:37.440,1:47:44.240
continue our adventure tomorrow with 
this storm being what it is and not

1:47:44.240,1:48:13.280
knowing knowing if that's plains or meadows ahead.

1:48:31.360,1:48:38.560
Going to run up there and see 
what I can tell from the shore.

1:48:38.560,1:48:47.600
Those

1:48:47.600,1:48:54.480
red flowers that we saw, those 
are common in the planes. So,

1:48:54.480,1:49:00.160
I don't think we're coming up on meadows.

1:49:00.160,1:49:07.840
I hear our friend the bear close by. 
He and the skeleton are going at it.

1:49:20.480,1:49:32.560
Let's dry off and get some sleep.

1:49:32.560,1:49:35.680
Tomorrow will be a new day.

1:50:18.480,1:50:24.560
Bear's picking a fight with 
somebody. As long as it's not us.

1:50:26.880,1:50:30.080
Let's put the portal in our pocket. Grab the

1:50:30.080,1:50:39.680
crafting table. We grabbed that a 
little too quickly. We should have

1:50:39.680,1:50:51.440
repaired our boat first. Not bad. Not bad uh 
shape, but we always want to repair first.

1:50:58.880,1:51:14.480
So it looked like uh those deciduous trees 
up ahead. Oh yeah, and the bear went at it.

1:51:14.480,1:51:19.760
You can see the deskto's needle left behind.

1:51:19.760,1:51:20.720
Wrong key.

1:51:23.680,1:51:27.200
forward to.

1:51:27.200,1:51:36.240
Let's drop our sail while we can use it anyway.

1:51:36.240,1:51:46.400
Not sure how long that will last since we're 
probably going to lose the wind's favor.

1:51:50.960,1:52:11.440
But yeah, that looks like planes. Can't 
tell for sure, but it looks like planes.

1:52:11.440,1:52:37.920
Lots of fine wood in the plains. And then you know 
it's plains when you see those huge stone pillars.

1:52:37.920,1:52:44.320
So the sealed tower is on this other 
island across to starboard side.

1:52:47.120,1:52:59.680
I didn't even see that until I looked at the 
map and saw that we had missed the sealed tower.

1:52:59.680,1:53:11.760
And we will get back to those quests. I think 
uh there's a nice fueling village on the

1:53:11.760,1:53:27.760
hilltop there. We'll get back to those quests 
once we have uh collected the silver armor.

1:53:27.760,1:53:38.960
At that point, I feel very confident 
that we can do the smoldering tomb.

1:53:38.960,1:53:41.840
There's two deaths.

1:53:44.480,1:53:48.320
and a fuel lane.

1:53:48.320,1:53:56.080
I'm glad we didn't get their attention

1:53:56.080,1:54:03.360
cuz that has happened to me before 
and it's no fun when you die at sea.

1:54:03.360,1:54:11.920
Well, we did earlier when that wraith attacked us. 
All right, that looks like a lot of shallows that

1:54:11.920,1:54:22.640
we're going to bypass. Let's just go ahead 
and turn the corner on this swamp up ahead.

1:54:22.640,1:54:26.720
And

1:54:26.720,1:54:32.000
he may be running out of

1:54:32.000,1:54:35.280
land on this island.

1:54:50.640,1:54:57.920
We should just pop out to West 
Shore and see if we left the

1:54:57.920,1:55:04.320
boat out there. That's probably 
the most logical place for it.

1:55:28.400,1:55:33.680
So that is a good size swamp. 
It looks like if it starts over

1:55:33.680,1:55:42.000
here and comes all the way to here, 
that would be a real good size swamp.

1:55:46.400,1:55:52.800
Let's get just a little 
closer so we can uh add that

1:55:52.800,1:56:09.120
shoreline to our map.

1:56:09.120,1:56:33.520
There we go. Now we can 
turn Head around the point.

1:57:06.240,1:57:13.040
So foggy. I'm hoping that we can turn here.

1:57:13.040,1:57:20.880
Looks like there's some trees, but 
they look like they're pretty thin.

1:57:23.200,1:57:29.120
That's the edge of the swamp. And 
then more black forest. The mist

1:57:29.120,1:57:38.720
is just blinding. At least we're out of it now.

1:57:43.760,1:57:48.960
Now, there is a good chance that we left

1:57:48.960,1:58:06.080
some meadows in the center of this 
continent that we didn't find.

1:58:06.080,1:58:20.240
And it looks like night is coming up on us.

1:58:20.240,1:58:27.520
I don't know. It may only be half

1:58:27.520,1:58:33.120
I think we still got half a day ahead of us,

1:58:33.120,1:58:57.520
but we do have the favor of 
the wind. So, let's take it.

1:59:04.800,1:59:17.360
That was a close call. That was a huge 
boulder that we just barely missed.

1:59:23.920,1:59:28.160
Interesting to see a cray dwarf nest right there.

1:59:29.120,1:59:53.120
I thought at first that was a troll cave, 
but I guess that's just a large rock.

2:00:01.280,2:00:09.280
Lost the wind.

2:00:09.280,2:00:13.760
The land of starboard.

2:00:13.760,2:00:18.640
Black forest.

2:00:29.440,2:00:37.120
But before we go further away 
from start, I want to check

2:00:37.120,2:00:44.240
this spot over here to see 
if there's any land in there.

2:00:47.120,2:01:02.720
And it looks like we're going to need to eat.

2:01:02.720,2:01:13.280
Oh my, more planes up ahead.

2:01:13.280,2:01:28.240
I had really hoped that was going to be Meadows.

2:01:28.240,2:01:36.800
Big old Mr. Bear standing on the shore there.

2:01:46.000,2:01:52.000
I think we've got enough 
distance from those plains.

2:01:52.000,2:01:55.760
And the starboard land looks like 
it's a mixture of black forest and

2:01:55.760,2:02:04.160
plains. We need to stay closer to 
the start to find more meadows.

2:02:11.440,2:02:22.320
And now we can't see anything 
with this fog rolling in.

2:02:22.320,2:02:31.600
Let's keep our distance from the shore, though.

2:02:31.600,2:02:52.480
Don't want to make friends with any.

2:02:52.480,2:03:05.600
Wouldn't hurt us for us to wear our uh 
route armor when we sail these expeditions.

2:03:05.600,2:03:14.320
Would definitely increase our 
longevity should we have an encounter.

2:03:14.320,2:03:18.720
Let's have some bacon.

2:03:34.240,2:03:43.760
Didn't notice we had the wind with 
us. It's glad to have it back.

2:03:54.320,2:03:56.960
Well, when it comes time to explore the plains,

2:03:56.960,2:04:03.760
which will be right after we finish with the 
mountains, we can come back this way because

2:04:03.760,2:04:11.920
there's plenty of planes here to explore. 
We've seen multiple fueling villages.

2:04:16.720,2:04:22.960
And that will be our gateway to the Mistlands.

2:04:22.960,2:04:36.960
Though I don't believe we're far enough out 
for there to be any mistlands in the area.

2:04:36.960,2:04:41.600
Now we're getting a little close for comfort.

2:04:41.600,2:04:50.560
Probably should steer slightly 
away from the shoreline again.

2:04:50.560,2:05:00.800
But I believe we're coming up on Black Forest 
up ahead. And we've lost our rested buff.

2:05:00.800,2:05:05.760
And that giant rock is something 
we definitely want to miss.

2:05:37.440,2:05:52.400
The ever so tiniest amount of meadows is 
here. So, let's go ahead and pull ashore

2:05:52.400,2:05:54.400
and search it out.

2:06:16.560,2:06:42.000
Going

2:06:42.000,2:06:45.440
to take a quick look around 
and see if we even have

2:06:54.080,2:07:00.640
enough space to look around.

2:07:00.640,2:07:05.920
Quickly switches back to Black Forest

2:07:05.920,2:07:12.080
and then back to Meadows again.

2:07:19.280,2:07:30.880
Small pig farm. That won't help us any.

2:07:30.880,2:07:36.240
And a another deer stand without it.

2:07:36.240,2:07:41.440
Yeah, I don't know that we're 
going to have any luck here.

2:08:30.240,2:08:39.920
Now this is when I wish I kept that hammer 
on me. Get that many around you and an AoE

2:08:39.920,2:08:52.640
effect becomes very effective. Otherwise just 
oneonone. The stack breaker is probably not

2:08:52.640,2:08:59.280
that useful a weapon. Well, it's a 
good place to stop for the night,

2:08:59.280,2:09:08.080
but that's not going to do 
us any good in our quest.

2:09:08.080,2:09:13.360
I think I hear a few skeletons behind me.

2:09:20.240,2:09:28.400
Let's go ahead and grab the

2:09:28.400,2:09:37.040
head back to home base.

2:09:37.040,2:09:40.800
Boat should be okay to overnight here.

2:09:42.320,2:09:48.960
Let's do a quick repair

2:09:48.960,2:10:05.040
and then we can push it out in the morning.

2:10:05.040,2:10:14.960
Another

2:10:14.960,2:10:21.600
day of fruitless searching.

2:10:21.600,2:10:34.400
In fact, we're having a harder time 
even finding areas with into search.

2:10:34.400,2:10:38.480
Well, let's

2:10:38.480,2:10:47.200
pardon me. Let's uh repair while we're here.

2:10:47.200,2:10:59.360
Get rid of some of these trophies 
we're carrying around. That's not it.

2:10:59.360,2:11:03.440
And meat.

2:11:03.440,2:11:07.040
Got

2:11:07.040,2:11:15.600
that spike rack spice rack in the way.

2:11:15.600,2:11:19.280
Oh yeah, we're going to pop over to 
West Shore and see if we can find the

2:11:19.280,2:11:30.560
big boat. If nothing else, it moves a little 
faster. Takes longer to tear down, though.

2:11:39.600,2:11:50.080
Ah, the new emote wheel. Haven't played with that 
much. Uh, especially since I'm so low, there's not

2:11:50.080,2:12:00.000
much uh reason that I would use it. But the 
hot key for the emote wheel is the letter T.

2:12:03.680,2:12:07.360
This is Greenshore.

2:12:07.360,2:12:18.720
It's not where I intended to go. 
I guess I got confused with the uh

2:12:18.720,2:12:23.200
emote.

2:12:23.200,2:12:28.160
Pardon me, with the emote wheel.

2:12:43.520,2:12:50.160
So, did we leave the boat here? We did not.

2:12:54.240,2:13:02.720
And just to double check, I'm almost 
positive we didn't leave it over here,

2:13:02.720,2:13:14.080
but I think these are all empty except 
for some rocks and a couple strawberries.

2:13:14.080,2:13:35.200
Speaking of which, let's grab four of 
these. We're not going to be here, but

2:13:35.200,2:13:46.000
where would we have left that? Hey guys, how 
many? Oh, I didn't realize we had that many.

2:13:46.000,2:13:48.320
One, two, three, four, five.

2:14:02.640,2:14:15.200
in this area. Yeah, we've covered most of 
this area. That's black forest. That's swamp.

2:14:26.320,2:14:35.600
We're going to check this out 
real quick. Um little bit of uh

2:14:35.600,2:14:43.280
the great green that's still on our homeland 
that we haven't bothered to look at.

2:14:44.880,2:14:59.280
So, let's pop back over to the house.

2:14:59.280,2:15:06.720
And let's take a look at portal one.

2:15:06.720,2:15:21.600
I believe it said there was a Drew garbar village 
there. In which case, let's grab our heavy armor.

2:15:21.600,2:15:27.520
That's still the best cave. 
Don't want to switch it out.

2:15:30.480,2:15:36.800
and our root harnesses.

2:15:36.800,2:15:54.160
I think that's the right pronunciation.

2:16:14.400,2:16:20.480
So there's not much reason to 
take out this Dugar Village.

2:16:20.480,2:16:32.399
Uh other than I feel 
compelled whenever I see these

2:16:32.399,2:16:33.439
to do so.

2:17:06.880,2:17:16.319
It's like we've got three axemen and one bow. So, 
the axemen don't bother me. I'm not too worried

2:17:16.319,2:17:28.080
about them as long as I don't have to take them 
all at the same time. The bow, on the other hand,

2:17:56.720,2:17:57.520
There we go.

2:18:01.920,2:18:07.520
have a hard time believing they 
would put the early axes inside

2:18:07.520,2:18:26.320
of a Dugar village. That sound was a fueling

2:18:29.439,2:18:38.719
Yes, we must be on the edge of the 
plains. And since that's the case,

2:18:38.720,2:18:45.120
I think we'll get out of here. Don't 
really want to take on a fueling just

2:18:45.120,2:18:55.280
yet. Not without the proper armor. 
And we would need at least silver.

2:19:00.399,2:19:07.599
So, we'll leave the Drewar village alone

2:19:07.600,2:19:13.920
and we'll carefully skirt the edge here.

2:19:13.920,2:19:20.560
Being careful not to step into the planes

2:19:20.560,2:19:23.040
too far.

2:19:52.720,2:20:01.200
And there there's the plane. So that's 
about as close as we want to get.

2:20:12.960,2:20:28.880
Same with there to our left.

2:20:39.840,2:20:52.720
So I believe just past this big oak we 
see a transition to plains. Not 100% sure.

2:20:52.720,2:20:56.560
No, I think we can go up this hill.

2:21:41.200,2:21:52.240
That's a bear. That's a black 
forest. So, I think we're okay.

2:21:52.240,2:21:54.880
That's a tower. So, that's black forest.

2:22:09.359,2:22:18.719
This is all black forest.

2:22:41.840,2:22:48.080
Yeah, here comes the troll.

2:22:48.080,2:22:55.760
Think we'll just leave him behind.

2:22:55.760,2:23:03.760
I hear a fueling.

2:23:03.760,2:23:11.520
So, the troll and the fueling are fighting.

2:23:11.520,2:23:15.520
Interesting. Who will win that fight?

2:23:31.680,2:23:40.880
get some very early black metal

2:23:40.880,2:23:51.120
if we wanted to venture into that. Nope. The 
fueling isn't dead. The troll wandered off.

2:23:51.120,2:23:53.280
Uh probably best for us just to get out

2:23:53.280,2:24:13.280
of the area because we're not 
really ready for refuelings.

2:24:20.160,2:24:30.559
And I think we've kind of closed 
the loop here. Wow, a lot of

2:24:30.560,2:24:38.241
that is one heck of a lot of bores in one area.

2:25:19.439,2:25:30.799
We need more sausage and more soup or 
stew. Going to have to go cook pretty soon.

2:25:55.920,2:25:58.960
Shield parry for the win.

2:26:20.640,2:26:27.360
Well, nothing but our little house here.

2:26:40.800,2:26:49.280
Oh man. Thought maybe we 
were on to something here.

2:26:49.280,2:26:53.599
Come on.

2:26:53.600,2:26:54.100
All

2:26:59.920,2:27:10.000
right.

2:27:10.000,2:27:17.680
Quite the little quanta hut we have.

2:27:46.800,2:28:11.120
We Probably better keep some 
of those arrows with us.

2:29:07.200,2:29:18.399
Got to check on the boat real quick.

2:29:18.399,2:29:20.240
Looks like it's in good shape.

2:29:24.160,2:29:46.720
We'll get some sleep and then 
we'll get back to sailing tomorrow.

2:29:52.960,2:30:03.120
I do wonder where we left that um big boat.

2:30:03.120,2:30:06.080
Going to have to spend some time just doing a

2:30:06.080,2:30:14.559
uh Oh, let's not leave this behind. Let's 
put this in our pocket before we head out.

2:30:23.200,2:30:39.519
I have a feeling that the boat is going 
to need some help getting out of here.

2:30:39.520,2:30:52.560
If we can get it turned around 
more the better. All right,

2:30:52.560,2:31:07.040
big wave pick us up and we get some 
steam underneath us and away we go.

2:31:07.040,2:31:12.319
Oh, it's going to rain on us. We're in 
the boat. Of course it's going to rain.

2:31:27.280,2:31:37.359
But there's a good chance that there's 
some more meadows between here and there.

2:32:19.920,2:32:26.560
keep turning like this. We're 
going to be sailing into the wind.

2:32:26.560,2:32:33.760
Let's watch out for that uh shallows ahead.

2:32:50.880,2:32:59.600
So when when I see that unadorned tower, it makes 
me think we're in the Black Forest versus when we

2:32:59.600,2:33:21.280
uh are in the plains, those same towers will 
be adorned. concerned with fueling additions.

2:33:21.280,2:33:26.399
And so it makes it pretty easy to tell where you

2:33:26.399,2:33:39.759
are when you see those fueling 
adornments on the tower. Those

2:33:39.760,2:33:54.319
big old waves are really 
tossing our little boat around.

2:33:54.319,2:33:59.519
try to pass on the uh shore 
side of those big rocks,

2:33:59.520,2:34:11.920
but it's a good chance we're going 
to have some uh bumps along the way.

2:34:11.920,2:34:18.560
It is quite the storm.

2:34:37.840,2:34:44.400
Let's see. What do we need? 
A little bite of bacon.

2:35:24.479,2:35:50.719
Those

2:35:50.720,2:35:53.920
big waves are really tossing 
our little boat around.

2:35:58.960,2:36:04.080
I think as long as we head 
into them kind of head on,

2:36:04.080,2:36:13.040
uh, we're less likely to run into 
trouble than if we go side to side

2:36:13.040,2:36:22.800
that then there's a good chance the 
wave will come along and capsite us.

2:36:22.800,2:36:44.319
But my fear here is hitting one 
of those rocks under the water.

2:36:44.319,2:36:49.840
That little bit of shallows 
right there may be hard to cross.

2:36:55.200,2:37:03.920
The waves are in our favor so far.

2:37:03.920,2:37:16.880
And we're coming up on the swamp.

2:37:40.560,2:37:49.280
Now we're going side to side over 
those waves. That's what scares me.

2:37:49.280,2:37:53.840
That's a little more head-on. That's better.

2:38:13.840,2:38:28.720
Got a leech trying to chase us down.

2:39:24.080,2:39:33.120
I do believe I see the lights 
of a sunken grip over there.

2:39:41.439,2:39:55.599
Going to try to turn into these waves,

2:39:55.600,2:39:58.160
but I get the feeling that there is some

2:39:58.160,2:40:25.519
uh meadows ahead of us. But I think it's I 
think it's meadows we've already explored.

2:40:31.280,2:40:44.960
The progress feels so slow when 
the storm is in our face like this.

2:40:44.960,2:40:52.720
And I hesitate to drop the sail because

2:40:52.720,2:40:54.400
of the waves.

2:40:56.880,2:41:20.160
But let's give it a shot or 
we're going to be here all day.

2:41:20.160,2:41:43.519
Wind needs to shift behind us so we 
can make this turn to port up here.

2:42:09.920,2:42:14.720
Ah, there's the sun.

2:42:14.720,2:42:21.200
Well, we're going to be sailing 
straight against the wind now.

2:42:46.240,2:42:51.280
So, we're going to turn this corner, head south,

2:42:51.280,2:43:00.160
and then turn west and see if there's 
any land in this general area.

2:43:22.000,2:43:31.600
Wish I knew where we left the big boat.

2:43:39.200,2:43:44.080
So I can see some land to

2:43:44.080,2:44:01.120
starboard there and I think that's our homeland.

2:44:08.000,2:44:14.399
That's where we first docked when we got here,

2:44:14.399,2:44:17.200
but I can't remember if we 
brought the big boat or the little

2:44:52.560,2:44:59.359
Well, we've lost our rested bonus.

2:44:59.359,2:45:05.439
Going to stop here and see if 
for chance we left the boat

2:45:05.439,2:45:12.639
behind here. I don't know why we 
would have not without a portal.

2:45:19.439,2:45:34.399
Yes.

2:45:34.399,2:45:40.000
All right. So, let's just sail southwest of here.

2:45:42.960,2:45:58.000
Only got about 10 more minutes in the day.

2:45:58.000,2:46:05.040
Guess we could sail down to this point and then 
launch from there. That'll make use of the 10

2:46:05.040,2:46:34.240
minutes. Get us a little bit closer. And it's not 
10 minutes. Can't be. Must be about four or five.

2:46:34.240,2:46:37.040
Oh, leave a mark.

2:46:46.399,2:47:04.319
And another one.

2:47:55.439,2:48:08.080
So, is that the homeland straight ahead? It's 
not. That's the other part of the island.

2:48:08.080,2:48:13.040
And it was swamp.

2:48:15.840,2:48:37.520
So, let's go back here and drop anchor.

2:48:45.200,2:49:03.679
Let's turn the boat around and back in.

2:50:03.920,2:50:32.720
So we say farewell to another day, get 
some sleep and sail again on tomorrow.

2:50:32.720,2:50:36.640
[ __ ]

2:51:25.840,2:51:34.080
Stew, little sausage

2:51:34.080,2:51:39.120
in the open sea.

2:51:39.120,2:51:41.840
And now we cross the serpent's way.

2:51:54.160,2:52:07.120
and we hope that Odin's will is with us.

2:52:34.240,2:52:44.000
Pull back this mist from my eyes and 
let me see what lies ahead of me.

2:52:49.680,2:52:55.439
or not.

2:52:55.439,2:53:05.439
That looks like land

2:53:05.439,2:53:11.599
towards that. Just remnants of the 
great tree shining through the mist.

2:53:14.240,2:53:39.679
I know not. Let's make a slight adjustment 
here. Head a little more southwest.

2:53:58.319,2:54:07.679
using common period to zoom 
in and out on the mini map.

2:54:07.680,2:54:14.399
Get a better feel for

2:54:14.399,2:54:35.120
See,

2:54:35.120,2:54:44.000
so if you happen to know what that white arrow on 
the mini map indicates, I'd love to hear about it.

2:54:44.000,2:55:02.080
Leave me a a note in the comments. 
I've always wondered about that.

2:55:02.080,2:55:09.359
Well, I see some uh

2:55:09.359,2:55:17.439
swamp land and black forest ahead of 
us. That's a good sign that we've found

2:55:17.439,2:55:25.679
the spot we were looking for. Now, 
can we find any of the great green?

2:55:25.680,2:55:34.960
And we lose the wind.

2:55:34.960,2:55:39.200
Maybe not completely.

2:55:48.000,2:56:05.040
Now it's gone.

2:56:16.240,2:56:24.240
large troll cave there and a great dwarf nest.

2:56:24.240,2:56:43.439
And the wind shifted to keep us 
heading straight into it. for shame.

2:56:43.439,2:56:55.200
Maybe once we clear those rocks up ahead, we 
can turn to port far enough to catch a breeze.

2:57:11.359,2:57:18.960
Quite the sandbar way out here.

2:57:28.800,2:57:45.040
Almost there.

2:58:03.359,2:58:08.080
So, we see the normal thatched roof on that tower.

2:58:08.080,2:58:13.680
Good indication that it's 
still in the black forest.

2:58:13.680,2:58:21.600
But that ragged looking tree up ahead 
indicates that we're in for more swamp land.

2:58:24.880,2:58:43.520
I was hoping I was definitely hoping for mess.

2:58:43.520,2:58:54.399
So looking across here, you can 
see swamp, swamp, swamp, but

2:58:54.399,2:59:08.319
doesn't look like it's going to be a large 
swamp, but you never know. Just never know.

2:59:18.880,2:59:34.720
This is a fool's quest we are on.

3:00:26.800,3:00:44.160
torch out in the middle of 
the water. That is rather odd.

3:01:23.520,3:01:27.279
I haven't seen

3:01:27.279,3:01:36.559
a tower with that build on 
the top like that before.

3:01:36.560,3:01:40.161
It's a new one.

3:01:43.040,3:01:45.760
Well, I think we're uh going to have an island of

3:01:45.760,3:02:09.600
mostly there is a sunken crypt 
there. Mostly just swamp land.

3:02:20.479,3:02:33.120
And we have yet to locate Aldor.

3:02:33.120,3:02:42.720
So now we've completed that circle 
where we're about to where to next.

3:02:42.720,3:03:00.480
We still want to take a look 
at this area right here.

3:03:30.880,3:03:35.760
forgot we still had our heavy 
army armor on. And actually,

3:03:35.760,3:03:47.279
I'm kind of glad we still have the harness 
gone because it's a great deterrent

3:03:47.279,3:03:49.200
for piercing.

3:03:50.960,3:03:56.000
If we were to run into a desk,

3:03:56.000,3:04:03.200
a fueling spear men

3:04:03.200,3:04:09.439
and a

3:04:09.439,3:04:10.399
Dger Archer.

3:04:19.520,3:04:25.439
Suppose I'm lowering the sail too soon.

3:04:25.439,3:04:35.679
See what happens if we stay on 
this course. At least for a bit.

3:05:09.120,3:05:13.279
Nighttime comes soon.

3:05:13.279,3:05:38.639
Let's put it sure.

3:05:38.640,3:05:42.560
Nice sandy beach area. Couple 
rocks, but not too bad.

3:06:10.319,3:06:15.840
Suppose we're going to have to take Mr. bear out.

3:06:15.840,3:06:37.200
Would be good to get the portal down first.

3:07:19.120,3:07:29.519
I was a little late on that dodge roll, but

3:07:29.520,3:07:35.201
brought the uh whole forest out to see us.

3:07:40.560,3:07:48.080
Well, we uh triggered our

3:07:48.080,3:07:58.960
trinket.

3:07:58.960,3:08:02.160
There we go.

3:08:06.399,3:08:12.000
Well, now that we've done all that, we 
might as well go see what's in the tower,

3:08:12.000,3:08:28.080
cuz I think half of those 
guys came from the tower.

3:08:42.800,3:08:54.560
And they can keep the wooden spear.

3:09:04.080,3:09:12.559
Oh, did I ever say there were 
too many bears in the forest?

3:09:12.560,3:09:18.479
The only only problem I have 
is that he may come along and

3:09:18.479,3:09:23.599
start tearing up our boat or our portal or both.

3:09:50.880,3:10:04.800
Ouch. I don't think I have my shield 
out. There we go. That's more like it.

3:10:04.800,3:10:13.200
Always have a hard time getting those bites.

3:10:13.200,3:10:20.399
Can't see much right now. Here we go. 
That's better. Was a better angle.

3:10:23.040,3:10:34.080
Yeah, we're pretty low on stamina.

3:10:34.080,3:10:39.760
All right, there we got our stamina. Come on back.

3:10:39.760,3:10:45.440
Oh, that bite.

3:11:05.760,3:11:12.000
The whole forest is going to come out 
to see us. That's pretty exciting.

3:11:18.560,3:11:22.560
All right.

3:11:22.560,3:11:36.640
Usually I clean up those logs that he 
knocks down, but not not really in the mood.

3:12:06.640,3:12:22.560
He's

3:12:22.560,3:12:33.359
on our He's inside the moat. I'll be 
dinged. Doesn't happen very often.

3:12:33.359,3:12:56.719
No, he's throwing rocks. I see.

3:12:56.720,3:13:01.200
Okay.

3:13:17.200,3:13:28.319
Got a little meat. We can get rid of that. 
Finally got rid of those wood arrows.

3:13:28.319,3:13:30.160
We need to do repairs.

3:13:38.880,3:13:42.960
and

3:13:42.960,3:13:56.640
drop off some of this.

3:13:56.640,3:13:58.960
We don't have any bear trophies.

3:14:07.920,3:14:14.960
I guess they are fairly rare.

3:14:14.960,3:14:22.399
Move this to one of our overflows.

3:14:22.399,3:14:27.920
That's overflow. And then this is 
going to shift everything down.

3:15:37.200,3:15:51.359
We need to get in bed so these things 
don't keep coming out of the woodwork.

3:16:04.479,3:16:08.959
Oh, come on.

3:16:08.960,3:16:15.680
It's been raining on us every day at sea.

3:16:15.680,3:16:19.439
All right, we were

3:16:19.439,3:16:20.879
putting things away.

3:16:36.720,3:16:47.920
Well, I don't want to sail in a storm like this. 
So, I'm going to work on the uh harvest here.

3:17:19.279,3:17:25.279
So the one thing about the world 
um weather in the world is it is

3:17:25.279,3:17:33.439
worldwide. So if it's raining 
here, it's raining everywhere.

3:17:33.439,3:17:40.719
The one exception to that might be in the 
ash lands. It's pretty hard to tell what's

3:17:40.720,3:17:49.920
happening in the rest of the world when you're 
in the ashlands because of the firestorms and

3:17:49.920,3:17:59.120
other things that happen. It seems to have 
a influence on the weather for that land and

3:17:59.120,3:18:05.840
not for the rest of the world. But outside 
of that, if it's raining here, it's raining

3:18:05.840,3:18:14.960
everywhere. If you're in the mountains, 
it'll be a blizzard and not a rainstorm.

3:18:14.960,3:18:18.800
And if you come down out of 
the mountains quickly enough,

3:18:18.800,3:18:40.800
it'll be a snowstorm when you get down here.

3:20:20.880,3:20:28.880
I was hoping that the rain 
would have stopped by now.

3:20:34.399,3:20:41.120
We want to leave those. No, I'm doing 
that wrong. We want to leave those 50

3:20:41.120,3:20:47.359
for planting. And then we plant all of 
our seeds. And then those 50 will give

3:20:47.359,3:20:57.120
us this 150 to replenish our seeds. 
So that's that. basically plant 50

3:20:57.120,3:21:07.519
turnups so that you get 150 seeds and 
plant 150 seeds so you get 150 turnups.

3:21:07.520,3:21:12.720
And let's move this down.

3:21:12.720,3:21:22.399
And we put our turnups up here

3:21:22.399,3:21:23.679
and we should eat.

3:21:37.600,3:21:49.520
And we should probably make some more turnup 
stew, which I believe is turnups and cornmeal.

3:22:18.960,3:22:24.560
More turnups.

3:22:59.279,3:23:14.000
As fast as we're going through 
turnups, we might want to plant some

3:23:35.439,3:23:40.479
Thought the cultivator was out here.

3:23:44.960,3:23:54.080
But no,

3:23:54.080,3:23:58.960
now the rain stops.

3:23:58.960,3:24:05.200
It's okay with me.

3:24:41.200,3:24:48.479
quick repair.

3:24:55.840,3:25:02.720
Holy cow.

3:25:02.720,3:25:08.080
Can't believe we made that 
kind of dent when we jumped.

3:25:08.080,3:25:14.319
Don't know what happened. That usually doesn't.

3:25:30.000,3:25:40.319
Okay, let's see if there's any land in 
here. Unlikely. It's kind of a small area.

3:25:59.760,3:26:05.600
The starboard side should be our

3:26:05.600,3:26:11.040
but I don't know about

3:26:11.040,3:26:19.200
right that way. I thought I saw something 
through the mist. It was probably just this land.

3:26:20.560,3:26:46.560
But we'll cut across here and see what we find.

3:26:49.200,3:27:15.359
So that's probably the mainland.

3:27:15.359,3:27:20.479
I'm thinking maybe we should be looking

3:27:20.479,3:27:44.080
to the north.

3:29:12.000,3:29:19.439
Going to head for portal one 
and probably call it there.

3:29:21.600,3:29:43.040
We're getting uh towards the end of the day.

3:31:07.520,3:31:21.920
I got me another fish.

3:32:02.880,3:32:08.560
Well, of course it isn't

3:32:08.560,3:32:12.800
frustrating.

3:33:41.200,3:33:45.840
Well, exiles, it's been a

3:33:45.840,3:33:48.960
long and frustrating trip.

3:34:05.040,3:34:14.399
So, I got to got to figure 
out where we left our uh

3:34:14.399,3:34:16.719
our boat.

3:34:18.800,3:34:28.640
First of all, let's go pick up the portal.

3:34:28.640,3:34:36.400
We want to have that travel portal 
for when we continue our searches.

3:34:40.479,3:34:43.519
But I do think I'm going to leave this workbench

3:34:43.520,3:35:03.360
here just in case we need next 
time we're in the neighborhood.

3:35:11.279,3:35:25.439
Well, that connected quickly.

3:35:25.439,3:35:29.839
Love that fireplace.

3:35:36.160,3:35:54.080
There's no boat here.

3:36:07.680,3:36:16.000
So if it's not there,

3:36:16.000,3:36:20.720
what's our other possibilities?

3:36:26.880,3:36:30.640
I doubt that we would have left it.

3:36:32.479,3:36:49.120
I don't think there's even a

3:36:49.120,3:36:56.880
says portal but no

3:36:56.880,3:37:07.600
no All right.

3:37:29.520,3:37:42.800
Where would be

3:37:42.800,3:37:44.320
I doubt that it's there, but

3:37:47.120,3:38:01.760
I don't think there's any 
even place to put it there.

3:38:01.760,3:38:06.880
Yeah, there's no chest around here.

3:38:10.080,3:38:31.680
Wait, there is a chest and it 
has 310 in it, but that's it.

3:38:38.720,3:38:46.560
So, what did we call it? Was it forest?

3:38:46.560,3:38:57.600
Looks like it.

3:39:18.160,3:39:23.760
I can't believe we left all this behind.

3:40:53.840,3:40:55.360
I don't get it.

3:49:45.760,3:50:00.080
I wonder does the mountains hold the 
key? Is that where we hid our boat?

3:50:04.080,3:50:11.040
Got a portal or more

3:50:11.040,3:50:20.399
iron and everything else

3:50:20.399,3:50:25.199
or

3:50:39.520,3:50:49.760
This is the last place we 
sailed to with that huge load.

3:51:12.399,3:51:17.599
But I don't see the nails 
that we need to make a boat.

3:51:43.920,3:51:46.640
Barely even set in on this place.

3:52:39.279,3:52:46.000
Since when are we missing the required station?

3:52:46.000,3:52:49.199
That seemed really weird.

3:53:20.640,3:53:24.720
must be getting late.

3:53:24.720,3:53:27.360
Well, exiles

3:53:28.960,3:53:36.160
It's uh very disturbing when you 
realize you can't find your boat

3:53:36.160,3:53:43.439
should be here.

3:53:50.160,3:53:55.040
Can't imagine what we did with the nails.

3:53:55.040,3:54:05.439
Even if everything else was been distributed 
somewhere else, the nails would be around.

3:54:05.439,3:54:09.599
Not going to be in there.

3:54:09.600,3:54:21.920
No nails. Nope. No. And no

3:54:21.920,3:54:36.160
bronze nails.

3:54:36.160,3:54:39.760
It's the little boat.

3:54:56.800,3:55:07.279
quite concerning.

3:55:07.279,3:55:17.679
Really has me thinking.

3:55:17.680,3:55:24.640
So where is uh So that's here.

3:55:24.640,3:55:32.800
We show this docked up here.

3:55:32.800,3:55:54.320
That was a long run.

3:56:40.960,3:56:46.880
Okay.

3:56:46.880,3:56:51.440
Suppose we're just going to make a new one.

3:57:14.960,3:57:20.319
and then maybe someday we'll find it.

3:57:20.319,3:57:26.399
Well, exiles,

3:57:26.399,3:57:34.319
we spent quite a bit of time 
searching just for more of the

3:57:34.319,3:57:47.519
great green to search. lot of sailing 
and not much to show for our effort.

3:57:47.520,3:57:50.800
But

3:57:50.800,3:58:00.720
we shall continue. And I think what 
we're going to do, head up here up north,

3:58:00.720,3:58:09.040
see what we can find in this area. We want to 
see uh the furthest we get from this location

3:58:09.040,3:58:18.319
right here. Further we get from the start, 
the less likely we are to find meadows. So

3:58:18.319,3:58:27.120
since this area up here to the north is closer to 
the start, maybe we can find something over here.

3:58:27.840,3:58:51.680
So, next time, let's launch from the start 
and let's try to find more lands in this area.

3:58:51.680,3:59:06.720
And maybe, just maybe, Aldor will 
stick up his head and say, "Here I am."

3:59:06.720,3:59:18.000
All of that looks like Black Forest.

3:59:18.000,3:59:19.760
So,

3:59:25.680,3:59:37.359
Looks like there's meadows right there. 
That would be a good place to start.

3:59:37.359,3:59:44.319
Didn't we put a

3:59:53.600,4:00:08.080
Yeah, we have a a green shore, but green shore 
is further away than start. We'll use dark

4:00:08.080,4:00:13.519
and relax. Until next time. The meat is cold,

4:00:13.520,4:00:23.520
the hurt is warm. I'm Grandpa 
Bud and we're playing Valheim.

4:00:23.520,4:00:28.720
Y'all have a good one.
