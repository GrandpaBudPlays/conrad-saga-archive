## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
My boots are thin from walking the Great Green. The Curious Axe Head is found, but the Mysterious one hides still. Today, we continue our search across the whale-road.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as he leaves the comfort of Othala-Garth to challenges across the Whale-Road. We push into the eastern horizons to scour distant shores for the final 5th Anniversary Relic and complete the Bronze Age Skip.
