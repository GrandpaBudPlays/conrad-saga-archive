## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
"The map is nearly full, the neighbors are getting meaner, and that second Axe Head is still playing hard to get."

Welcome back to the hunt! We are heading into Part III of the quest for the Valheim 5th Anniversary Relics. We have one piece of the puzzle, but the Meadows is starting to show its teeth.

The Story So Far:
In Part II, things got "interesting." We pushed the boundaries of our homeland and found more than we bargained for—outlining new Mountain peaks and stumbling right into the Swamp. We even found a small back corner of the Meadows that turned out to be a Draugr Village. That little discovery cost us a brief corpse run, but unfortunately, it didn't give up the prize.

The Mission Today:
We are down to the final slivers of unexplored Meadows on our home continent. We are desperately searching for that last WoodHouse 2 (A-frame) .

The goal is to complete the set—Mysterious + Curious Axe Heads—so we can craft the Early Axes at a Level 1 Workbench with just 4 Wood. If the second head isn't in these last few Meadows pockets, our "home land" search is over, and the hunt goes nautical.
Current Objective:

The Missing Piece: Find the 2nd Axe Head before we run out of land.
The Locations: Chests in unexplored Meadows ruins (Avoiding the Draugr this time!).

The Stakes: Complete the "Bronze Age Skip" or start building a boat for a long voyage.
Will the Meadows finally give up its secrets, or are we destined for the open sea? Grab a seat and let's find out! (Spoiler, we end up sailing)

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:05.280,0:00:13.280
And welcome back Grandpa. We're playing Valheim. 
We're going to continue the search for the early

0:00:13.280,0:00:25.680
axes. Uh hopefully we're getting close, 
but so far the prize has been very elusive.

0:00:27.920,0:00:37.360
Looks like we've got a small sliver of meadows 
left on this section of the island and then we

0:00:37.360,0:00:49.760
will head back in the other direction 
to finish outlining that inland sea.

0:00:49.760,0:00:55.040
So, let's pick up our portal 
and let's get started looking.

0:00:57.600,0:01:06.320
Where's that workbench? I know it's 
right here somewhere. There we go.

0:01:06.320,0:01:11.840
Okay. So, let's just fill in 
this little bit right here.

0:01:11.840,0:01:21.280
That's about all there is left in this section.

0:01:40.960,0:01:43.440
I keep seeing those rocks from a distance,

0:01:43.440,0:01:50.240
thinking, "Oh, there's a house. Maybe 
that's it." But they're just rocks.

0:02:04.720,0:02:23.280
And that black forest we're probably 
not going to need to venture too.

0:02:23.280,0:02:29.600
As now I'm walking into it. 
I just wanted the map to

0:02:29.600,0:02:35.600
look like I was in the Black Forest.

0:02:40.400,0:02:43.920
Guys,

0:02:43.920,0:02:51.520
maybe we should eat some food.

0:02:51.520,0:03:04.720
Definitely should eat some food.

0:03:09.680,0:03:31.440
I don't care to mess with the bear right 
now. We got more time pressing matters.

0:03:40.000,0:03:43.360
All right,

0:03:43.360,0:03:51.040
one more grey dwarf, I suppose.

0:03:51.040,0:03:53.200
I believe the last time we were by here,

0:03:53.200,0:04:00.960
we looked at that runstone. I 
don't think that's something new.

0:04:06.160,0:04:13.920
Yeah, I believe we've read that before.

0:04:13.920,0:04:25.200
And getting all kinds of interruptions. All right. 
So, what we really want to do is we want to pick

0:04:25.200,0:04:37.280
up this water line. So, I think we're going to run 
around here, trace this edge. We're not going to

0:04:37.280,0:04:43.680
go into the Black Forest, but we'll go, if this 
is Black Forest, we'll follow it around till we

0:04:43.680,0:04:51.200
get back to this water line. So, we're just 
going to fill in that map. Let's go ahead and

0:04:51.200,0:05:05.280
use our ether power. Not ready. Well, in one 
minute we will. In the meantime, here we go.

0:05:05.280,0:05:14.320
Keep your eye open for buildings,

0:05:14.320,0:05:23.520
but this is all territory we've covered before.

0:05:23.520,0:05:27.280
30 seconds.

0:05:27.280,0:05:48.080
I didn't mark this one last 
time. I should have done that.

0:06:07.040,0:06:13.440
Trees are getting pretty dense through here.

0:06:18.880,0:06:25.840
So, at this point, we're going to go ahead and

0:06:25.840,0:06:38.720
follow the edge of the black forest to this point.

0:07:28.640,0:07:29.920
Where I'll be?

0:07:36.560,0:07:54.640
Didn't we run this coastline?

0:07:54.640,0:07:58.240
Well, I wasn't expecting meadows here.

0:08:11.200,0:08:19.440
This is uh not the way I thought 
this land was going to be laid out.

0:08:19.440,0:08:24.800
All right.

0:08:24.800,0:08:26.640
Nothing there.

0:10:01.040,0:10:07.120
Just mapping out the edge of the black forest here

0:10:07.120,0:10:15.280
till we can tie this together. And then we'll 
double back in the direction we came from.

0:10:32.960,0:10:37.360
So, we've been here

0:10:37.360,0:10:43.200
and I think this is the kind of 
tower that we found the first time.

0:11:02.720,0:11:12.800
Man, there's a slew of grey dwarfs, man. 
Rather small army of grey dwarfs there.

0:11:12.800,0:11:16.240
All right, let's take out the 
beehive. Not that we need a bee,

0:11:16.240,0:11:24.720
but we don't need to get stung either. And 
I don't even know if there's a treasure

0:11:24.720,0:11:36.800
chest up there. And I don't I think we're 
still looking for the A-frame, not the

0:11:36.800,0:11:41.840
not the wood tower. But maybe we're 
looking for the wood tower because

0:11:41.840,0:11:53.040
I have to go back and rewatch the video to 
see where we found the first one with Iris.

0:11:53.040,0:12:00.880
Well, no, Iris wasn't in this world. 
My bad. There's the chest. And there

0:12:00.880,0:12:12.080
is a curious axe head. Are we 
curious or are we mysterious?

0:12:12.080,0:12:18.720
Is that number two or are we dumb?

0:12:18.720,0:12:23.920
We're going to have to find out.

0:12:23.920,0:12:30.560
So, let's uh go ahead and drop 
a workbench in here. That way,

0:12:30.560,0:12:34.480
we can take down this shelf and 
grab that queen that's up there.

0:12:40.000,0:12:46.000
Oh, and all of that stuff fell out 
of the chest that we were going to

0:12:46.000,0:12:53.840
leave. We can put the chest on the floor here.

0:12:53.840,0:13:02.880
And let's put some of that stuff back that 
we don't want, such as that, that, etc.

0:13:28.560,0:13:32.640
Well,

0:13:32.640,0:13:41.200
are we going to end up with a extra axe 
head or have we completed our quest?

0:13:46.480,0:13:53.360
Curious and curious. Curiouser and curiouser. So,

0:13:53.360,0:14:03.520
we're still hunting. We haven't 
haven't finished our hunt yet.

0:14:07.280,0:14:09.680
Now, if it was a race to get queen bees,

0:14:09.680,0:14:16.640
we'd definitely be winning because 
we have got plenty of those

0:14:16.640,0:14:28.400
and lots of boring, but not the axe head we're 
looking for. So, it definitely is the A-frame.

0:14:28.400,0:14:44.560
I thought it was the tower that we found first. I 
was Halfway confident of that, but only just half.

0:14:44.560,0:14:52.560
It was at least worth looking into.

0:14:52.560,0:15:01.280
All right, so now let's let's finish 
out this peninsula right here.

0:15:02.720,0:15:08.240
much different shape to the 
land than what I expected.

0:15:08.240,0:15:19.040
So, let's just do this and that. Then that should 
do it. Actually, let's go this way and then this

0:15:19.040,0:15:29.440
way. And then we'll be right back to here. 
That looks better. So, that's Black Forest.

0:15:31.920,0:15:40.560
We want to go this way. Well, with 
the curious head that close by,

0:15:40.560,0:15:47.440
I think it's unlikely that we're going to 
find a mysterious head in the same area.

0:15:49.520,0:15:54.880
So, if we're like in the same section of the

0:15:54.880,0:16:06.960
of the meadows, somehow I feel like 
there's further spread apart than this.

0:16:06.960,0:16:12.560
No buildings.

0:16:25.040,0:16:40.960
All right.

0:16:49.920,0:17:07.840
Just want to add this section to the map.

0:17:31.520,0:17:37.360
I feel like most of this is not new to us.

0:17:41.120,0:17:55.840
Let's get it on the map.

0:17:55.840,0:18:02.000
Short little swim.

0:18:12.320,0:18:31.360
all the inland sea. And that is

0:18:31.360,0:18:35.520
We could at least get a

0:18:35.520,0:18:40.240
swim point out of this. Come on.

0:18:40.240,0:18:42.960
Nope. Okay.

0:18:53.440,0:19:09.760
And this isn't very new. This is all We've 
been here before. So, let's get on out of here.

0:19:25.520,0:19:30.960
Must be night time. Can we get across?

0:19:30.960,0:19:56.720
like to get back to oh, I guess what I consider 
the mainland before we throw down our portal

0:20:03.200,0:20:06.480
So, it looks like that clearing 
hasn't been explored. So,

0:20:06.480,0:20:16.560
I think that's where we'll 
pick it up in the morning.

0:20:23.200,0:20:34.320
As long as the neck don't try to eat 
our portal overnight, we should be okay.

0:20:34.320,0:21:02.880
A little too soon maybe.

0:21:02.880,0:21:07.520
That's deer meat again.

0:21:07.520,0:21:10.080
I don't know why they don't why they won't say on

0:21:10.080,0:21:29.360
the same timing. It's interesting 
to me. Curious, I guess should say.

0:21:53.040,0:21:57.040
All right. So, from here, let's 
uh looks like we've got a little

0:21:57.040,0:22:20.240
gap before the black forest. So, 
let's cross over and check it out.

0:23:03.440,0:23:08.560
[ __ ] this.

0:23:08.560,0:23:11.760
[ __ ] this.

0:23:31.600,0:23:37.680
So, let's outline this coast so we know 
what we got. Okay, there's the Black Forest.

0:23:38.880,0:23:43.600
thought it was going to be much closer, but

0:23:43.600,0:24:05.600
it wasn't. So, now we'll outline the black for us.

0:24:17.120,0:24:32.480
That's why

0:24:50.960,0:24:58.400
We didn't mark um the one we did find, but 
don't think we're coming back for these.

0:24:58.400,0:25:22.240
The point of marking them is to know 
what we have found and what remains.

0:25:46.320,0:25:48.080
Thought maybe we'd find more mountains,

0:25:48.080,0:26:02.560
but I guess not. Now, looks like 
we have outlined all of that.

0:26:02.560,0:26:13.280
After we get done with this guy, 
let's take a look at our map

0:26:13.280,0:26:17.200
and

0:26:17.200,0:26:25.840
we're up against the mountains there.

0:26:25.840,0:26:31.520
Black forest there. Guess we're 
going to follow the coastline here.

0:26:33.120,0:26:42.400
Let's see if we can tie back to 
what's this shore is clear over here.

0:26:42.400,0:27:02.720
So reverse as this is all done.

0:27:02.720,0:27:08.000
Let's go ahead and eat.

0:27:15.600,0:27:23.360
Just want to catch this coast right 
here where we left off and fill it in.

0:27:23.360,0:27:28.640
That big copper deposit.

0:27:28.640,0:27:33.920
Should do it.

0:27:33.920,0:27:36.320
Nice troll cave.

0:28:02.720,0:28:13.520
Looks like we got a gray 
dwarf nest ahead. ahead of us.

0:28:13.520,0:28:22.960
Let's get some stamina. Let's make 
sure we approach with lots of stamina.

0:28:22.960,0:28:28.320
Typically find a brute

0:28:28.320,0:28:33.040
whenever we get close to grey dwarf nest.

0:28:56.880,0:29:01.600
Well, here comes the whole gang.

0:29:22.080,0:29:26.480
Hopefully there's a chest over here. We 
can get rid of our unused stuff and trade

0:29:26.480,0:29:36.800
it for stuff we want. All right. don't want 
ancient seeds and I don't want grey dwarf

0:29:36.800,0:29:40.080
trophies.

0:29:40.080,0:29:47.760
The rest of this though, I think we can 
use. So, we're going to keep all of it.

0:29:47.760,0:29:58.560
We could lighten our load a little 
bit. Just leave 20 rock behind

0:29:58.560,0:30:09.760
and We could probably leave. Oh, 
Mr. Bear. Mr. Bear. Mr. Bear.

0:30:09.760,0:30:28.400
Let's just run around Mr. Bear cuz 
there's no need to disturb his slumber.

0:30:53.840,0:30:57.520
Just want to put this on the map. 
You never know when we're going to

0:30:58.800,0:31:08.400
Well, that's weird. I've never seen an entrance 
that it actually looked blocked. I'm sure it's

0:31:08.400,0:31:22.480
not. And we're not going to go in, but you never 
know when you're going to need one of these.

0:31:22.480,0:31:27.840
We're as far into the game as we are, 
it's probably we're not going to need

0:31:27.840,0:31:48.880
one because we can go to the circling pits 
and get all the circling cores we want.

0:31:52.400,0:32:02.720
You guys can just follow 
me. That be perfectly fine.

0:32:02.720,0:32:11.200
Another deposit. And here 
we are back in the meadows.

0:32:11.200,0:32:17.600
So, let's uh let's run off and leave these guys.

0:32:21.200,0:32:39.920
And let's just kind of scout out 
the edge of this black forest.

0:33:26.640,0:33:42.960
Another one.

0:34:03.520,0:34:08.560
How did we get so deep into 
the black forest? I thought

0:34:08.560,0:34:15.920
we were on the edge of the Yeah, it's right here

0:34:15.920,0:34:20.800
the the edge of the meadows.

0:34:20.800,0:34:28.160
ducked inside that burial chamber just for a 
minute so maybe that hoping the gray dwarfs

0:34:28.160,0:34:37.040
that were chasing us and the bear would 
lose interest. It appears to have worked

0:34:37.040,0:34:47.680
and it allowed us a minute to mark the map.

0:34:47.680,0:35:08.240
Not seeing much in the way of buildings though.

0:35:08.240,0:35:16.640
Finding all kinds of burial 
chambers, that's for sure.

0:35:16.640,0:35:38.880
as we run past and we can hear the uh skeletons 
fighting the grey dwarves and greylings.

0:35:57.040,0:36:01.040
Now, here's a new A-frame.

0:36:01.040,0:36:05.600
We haven't been here before.

0:36:08.880,0:36:15.520
But not the one we're looking for. What else? 
Anything in here we don't want? I thought we got

0:36:15.520,0:36:29.840
rid of 20 rock last time. We only want to get rid 
of 19 this time. Could be 30 rock if we had more.

0:36:29.840,0:36:55.760
All right, let's go get our rested 
buff right after we say goodbye to him.

0:37:06.800,0:37:13.360
Is it late enough in the afternoon that we want to

0:37:13.360,0:37:25.280
go ahead and sleep?

0:37:25.280,0:37:49.280
You know, it's the perfect time to go see Halair

0:38:07.600,0:38:11.840
What?

0:38:11.840,0:38:18.080
Okay, we've been here and done 
this before and last time I'm

0:38:18.080,0:38:30.480
sure we marked the map. Elder portal 
one hill deer. How deer? Gill deer.

0:38:30.480,0:38:38.160
Oh my.

0:38:38.160,0:38:53.840
He'll die.

0:38:54.720,0:39:06.800
Got some stuff to sell you, honey. 
Give me a good price, will you?

0:39:06.800,0:39:22.080
Thank you much.

0:39:23.920,0:39:37.440
That freed up a little bit 
of inventory space for us.

0:39:37.440,0:39:47.200
Let's go ahead and drop

0:39:47.200,0:39:50.880
30.

0:39:50.880,0:39:58.800
And it's close enough. Let's get some 
sleep and we'll start again in the morning.

0:39:58.800,0:40:04.400
Well, we found two axe heads. They just weren't 
two different axe heads. We found two of the same

0:40:04.400,0:40:16.160
one. I've got to think it's it's here close by. 
I was really hoping that last one was it. Uh,

0:40:16.160,0:40:33.120
let's rename this back to start so we don't 
get lost like we usually do. That looks good.

0:40:39.680,0:40:45.040
And now

0:40:45.040,0:40:52.160
got our portal

0:40:52.160,0:41:00.320
and we're all set. What do we leave 
here? Just some rock. That's fine.

0:41:00.320,0:41:02.640
Okay.

0:41:04.400,0:41:11.520
So,

0:41:11.520,0:41:15.440
going to follow this edge on 
around to this coast. Double

0:41:15.440,0:41:23.440
back and fill in that gap. And I think we'll have

0:41:23.440,0:41:31.280
just about polished off everything. 
I didn't want to do that.

0:41:32.320,0:41:42.800
Right in the middle. Okay. Right 
about there. I still did it again

0:41:42.800,0:42:00.640
there. That's what I wanted. Okay. So, 
we're going to keep going this way.

0:42:12.960,0:42:28.160
Yeah, read that one before.

0:42:34.080,0:42:43.120
No shortage of

0:42:43.120,0:42:50.000
burial chambers. No shortage 
of burial chambers whatsoever.

0:42:50.000,0:42:55.040
Always get stuck looking for the right term.

0:43:13.840,0:43:20.640
Should be seeing the coast before too long.

0:43:28.160,0:43:40.480
Well, we know we've been Well, let's just 
get let's just catch sight of the coast here.

0:43:40.480,0:43:47.040
There we go. Now, let's double back.

0:43:55.680,0:44:08.880
There's a house. And we should have 
checked this one out last time.

0:44:08.880,0:44:16.000
Looks like we did. And that's why we 
are trying to mark them on the map.

0:44:18.960,0:44:39.120
Okay, I'm good.

0:45:35.600,0:45:43.680
Don't remember being here before, but it 
looks to me like it's marked on our map.

0:45:46.160,0:45:55.520
So, this is where we started the 
morning and we didn't mark it.

0:45:55.520,0:46:19.760
All right. So, we're going to continue along 
this line here and pick up that piece of coast.

0:46:30.480,0:46:35.120
There was a time those bones would 
have been important and we would

0:46:35.120,0:46:44.240
have really needed them. This is not that time.

0:46:48.160,0:47:10.320
All right, I'll eat. What do we need? Deer meat.

0:47:10.320,0:47:13.360
Yet another altar to ether.

0:47:18.320,0:47:42.000
Hot T can.

0:47:42.000,0:47:46.560
And another tower.

0:47:46.560,0:48:05.760
I think I'll leave it. Let's 
go ahead and mark it though.

0:48:16.160,0:48:20.320
Thought we went in this one.

0:48:20.320,0:48:32.720
Guess not.

0:49:26.560,0:49:31.360
Could

0:49:31.360,0:49:53.920
be, but it's not. You can keep the torch.

0:50:03.840,0:50:16.800
So, if you get completely bored 
looking for early access on your world,

0:50:16.800,0:50:22.720
you can always grab the world 
seed out of the description

0:50:22.720,0:50:29.520
and then Just run to the areas where 
I found the early axes, pick them up,

0:50:29.520,0:50:38.720
and take them back to your world 
completely. What I would consider

0:50:38.720,0:50:52.400
as coloring outside the 
lines, but that's up to you.

0:50:52.400,0:50:58.880
I was Astrid, the shield maiden of the 
forest. I know nothing of my life before

0:50:58.880,0:51:04.720
I came here. But my arm remembers the 
sword, and my eyes see the course of

0:51:04.720,0:51:15.280
the arrow. Now the raven guides me, and 
I fight the great beasts in Odin's name,

0:51:15.280,0:51:20.080
much as Conrad does the same.

0:51:23.440,0:51:30.480
All right. Uh, lost a little track 
here. We got this gap in the middle. So,

0:51:30.480,0:51:39.280
we're here. Let's head for that.

0:51:39.280,0:51:48.480
Not too worried about that grane that's trying 
to stab me in the back. His knife is very dull.

0:51:52.240,0:52:00.640
Not much of a threat to us.

0:52:00.640,0:52:14.000
Another burial site inside of here.

0:52:14.000,0:52:18.960
And those giant monoliths. I 
hope before they release they

0:52:18.960,0:52:27.280
do something with these. They're 
too cool just to leave untouched.

0:52:27.280,0:52:37.280
I want to know their story. 
I want to know their secret.

0:52:44.320,0:52:53.600
So, little stew, some sausage, 
get us back into fighting shape.

0:52:53.600,0:53:01.360
We shouldn't have let ourselves go like that.

0:53:09.280,0:53:20.240
Well, right there looks like the perfect place 
to me to put the house that we're looking for.

0:53:20.240,0:53:27.920
Unfortunately, they didn't 
agree and it's not there.

0:53:32.400,0:53:40.560
And another burial site

0:53:40.560,0:53:49.200
very common in the plains.

0:53:49.200,0:53:54.880
We like to honor our far our fallen warriors.

0:54:04.640,0:54:11.840
Well, that's an interesting building up ahead.

0:54:11.840,0:54:16.720
It's not an A-frame, though.

0:54:16.720,0:54:22.320
Just an interesting building.

0:54:22.320,0:54:24.000
Not even a chest.

0:54:31.520,0:54:36.160
Okay,

0:54:36.160,0:54:42.160
I think we've filled in that portion of the map.

0:54:42.160,0:54:50.800
We've got this little section 
right here, this section,

0:54:50.800,0:54:58.000
that section. And then we weren't 
even going to do that section,

0:54:58.000,0:55:03.840
but there's the start. Let's go 
back here and then go that way,

0:55:03.840,0:55:12.000
I guess. Ah, doesn't matter much at this point.

0:55:12.000,0:55:20.320
Some nice meadows on this 
island. That definitely could be.

0:55:20.320,0:55:30.480
All right. Do we have ether? Not for 12 minutes.

0:55:30.480,0:55:35.120
Well, we might as well.

0:55:35.120,0:55:45.680
Let's do this and see if we can hit 
the start instead of dropping a portal.

0:55:55.360,0:55:58.960
If there's a building in these trees,

0:55:58.960,0:56:10.960
those are hard to find. Like this 
one, I almost walk right past it.

0:56:10.960,0:56:14.720
I don't really want that, 
but the rest of it I'll keep.

0:56:19.520,0:56:38.880
Oh, almost forgot.

0:56:49.760,0:57:06.400
So if it's in these trees, 
there's a good chance we miss it.

0:57:17.440,0:57:29.280
Is this the boar again?

0:57:29.280,0:57:34.320
The paneer.

0:57:34.320,0:57:41.600
Long ages passed when all Father Odin united the 
worlds. He threw down the veneer, the giants,

0:57:41.600,0:57:47.280
and those creatures older than the others. 
The greatest of them could not be killed,

0:57:47.280,0:57:55.120
but were instead forsaken, exiled here to 
Valheim for eternity. When they tread the earth,

0:57:55.120,0:58:03.040
the lesser creatures jump like crumbs on a drum 
skin. You will know them when you see them.

0:58:04.240,0:58:13.600
and see them. We have so far we have seen three.

0:58:13.600,0:58:25.120
And if we can ever get this little quest 
done, we'll go for the for the fourth.

0:58:26.560,0:58:32.480
This little quest is uh 
probably not worth the time,

0:58:32.480,0:58:40.960
but it is something that I 
just feel driven to complete.

0:58:40.960,0:58:50.720
All right, we're going to run back to 
the start and grab the portal there.

0:58:50.720,0:59:15.600
I wonder if that was the first tower we found. 
I think it is. where we found the first axe.

0:59:26.160,0:59:41.200
Grillings.

0:59:41.200,0:59:44.240
The sacrificial stones are near.

0:59:51.600,1:00:08.320
And our portal is just on the other side.

1:00:34.560,1:00:42.080
Got to be careful here. We don't want to unpack 
parts of the portal, which right now if I

1:00:42.080,1:01:08.720
clicked place stacks like I normally do, that's 
exactly what would happen. and here. So we won't

1:01:08.720,1:01:13.760
this we can take outside

1:01:13.760,1:01:18.080
since we're carrying too much. 
Let's just put it here close by.

1:01:32.640,1:01:44.560
And then we've got overflow, which I don't believe 
in the overflow area we have anything left.

1:01:44.560,1:01:47.120
Let's go ahead and swap this out.

1:01:50.640,1:01:59.040
And let's swap this out.

1:01:59.040,1:02:14.960
File bones could definitely go here.

1:02:19.760,1:02:39.120
That looks good. Let's get some sleep.

1:02:49.120,1:03:04.240
Well, nothing like starting out in a rainstorm.

1:03:09.920,1:03:33.120
So very little left. This spot, this spot, 
this spot, and that's in the black forest.

1:03:33.120,1:04:01.600
Visibility is terrible.

1:04:31.120,1:04:53.760
this. admit that's for sure.

1:05:02.400,1:05:19.120
That one's not on our map yet. Or was it?

1:05:31.520,1:05:55.040
All right, let's go do this area. Pick 
up this little spot here on the way.

1:05:55.040,1:06:00.320
He'll just keep pestering us.

1:06:15.520,1:06:20.880
thought I saw

1:06:20.880,1:06:25.440
something right there.

1:06:25.440,1:06:28.480
I did, but it's tiny.

1:06:36.880,1:06:54.640
Nothing. All right, keep going.

1:07:04.640,1:07:30.080
Been

1:07:30.080,1:07:33.360
here before. Didn't mark it.

1:07:43.520,1:08:10.800
This one we did mark. So, let's head back here.

1:08:48.400,1:08:55.840
at this one before.

1:08:55.840,1:09:01.520
Pushing all the wrong keys to get rid of it.

1:09:17.840,1:09:29.360
A little tiny bit there that we haven't done,

1:09:29.360,1:09:41.040
but we can see there's nothing 
there. And now it's done.

1:09:41.040,1:09:47.520
And

1:09:47.520,1:09:55.760
that's the Black Forest. So, I 
guess we'll go for this area.

1:10:07.040,1:10:14.000
Try to skip those bores just 
because there's no reason to.

1:10:14.000,1:10:18.480
Not

1:10:18.480,1:10:22.160
nothing.

1:10:29.760,1:10:48.160
Lots of raspberries.

1:10:48.160,1:10:51.280
Well, kids, it looks like 
we're going to go sailing.

1:10:52.960,1:11:03.120
Don't know that we have a 
much of a much of a choice.

1:11:03.120,1:11:18.960
Let's have a little uh deer stew.

1:12:58.640,1:13:06.640
Yeah, definitely read about this skipore guy.

1:13:06.640,1:13:14.320
Wait, wrong house. Wrong type of house.

1:13:24.960,1:13:33.680
back to the start and let's go get our boat.

1:13:33.680,1:13:41.280
That's Eekler. Okay, just past 
Eclair is the start. That's fine.

1:14:09.920,1:14:15.760
I missed it. I run right past it

1:14:15.760,1:14:21.600
more or less.

1:14:21.600,1:14:30.000
Let's just launch from the start probably.

1:14:30.000,1:14:36.960
And given it's a short trip, 
let's take the small boat.

1:14:44.320,1:14:59.520
Oh, we got to have food. Let's 
cook. Let's clean out and cook.

1:14:59.520,1:15:03.440
Got a stack.

1:15:33.200,1:15:39.760
Gonna have to go through and get things 
sorted together one of these days. Wow,

1:15:39.760,1:15:48.640
we picked up a 100 flint arrowheads. 
We should be using the last of these.

1:16:00.560,1:16:08.960
Flat. Flat. Okay.

1:16:08.960,1:16:15.520
Yeah, we need more than that. 
Let's get rid of these wood arrows.

1:16:20.480,1:16:37.920
Let's do this.

1:16:37.920,1:16:42.160
And a little boat.

1:16:46.720,1:16:56.320
Don't think we need 50. I think 
it's only like let's see what is it.

1:16:56.320,1:17:10.800
20. So that's a lot that we don't need to carry.

1:17:50.080,1:17:56.480
We need sausages and we need deer stew.

1:17:56.480,1:17:59.120
That'll take care of the sausage problem.

1:17:59.120,1:18:12.480
That'll refill our turnup stew. But we're 
going to have to cook deer meat for deer stew.

1:18:12.480,1:18:17.520
And it doesn't look like

1:18:17.520,1:18:26.320
we have a great deal of deer meat remaining.

1:18:28.880,1:18:42.000
Not ready to make anything with wolf meat.

1:18:42.000,1:18:52.160
That's stamina. That's stamina. Well, that 
we're already eating. That's stamina. For

1:18:52.160,1:19:07.120
what we're doing, stamina would actually work. 
The muck shake. How are we doing on blueberries?

1:19:07.120,1:19:18.560
Not enough that I want to waste them.

1:19:18.560,1:19:47.920
Board jerky. We've got that and it will serve 
our purpose. So we are going to make bore jerky.

1:20:25.280,1:20:27.120
Don't want that around anyway.

1:20:32.240,1:20:38.880
So, we're overweight because we had 
too much food. That's hilarious.

1:20:41.920,1:21:04.960
Tomorrow we sail.

1:21:43.520,1:21:52.640
That definitely Don't leave 
a mark. Let's fix that up.

1:21:52.640,1:22:09.760
And away we go.

1:22:20.240,1:22:22.160
So, we're just going to sail straight over

1:22:22.160,1:22:34.480
to here and start searching that 
meadows. We should eat, though.

1:22:48.480,1:22:58.880
Got used to that big boat speed. Doesn't compare.

1:22:58.880,1:23:02.720
Going to try to steer away from the black forest.

1:23:09.200,1:23:11.840
I do hope that is meadows. Yeah,

1:23:11.840,1:23:25.040
it says meadows. I would hate to go 
jump in on the planes all of a sudden.

1:23:31.760,1:23:46.400
Nice soft landing spot. 
That's what we want. No rocks.

1:23:46.400,1:23:51.200
Maybe right by the deer.

1:24:44.240,1:24:48.640
It's getting hot. Had to cool off a little.

1:24:57.600,1:25:02.720
We got plenty of room, right?

1:25:02.720,1:25:11.520
Uh let's put the portal up

1:25:11.520,1:25:16.080
that way. We've got lots of room.

1:25:18.800,1:25:27.680
And we don't have to worry about weight.

1:25:27.680,1:25:34.480
And there we go. Looks like 
we've got the whole boat.

1:25:34.480,1:25:44.640
Let's go. Put it in a carton. In 
a box. In a chest. In a chest.

1:26:56.960,1:27:06.240
You know, I think if we get half a chance, 
we probably better shoot a few of these deer.

1:27:14.800,1:27:33.360
For some reason, I thought that was Black 
Forest, but it doesn't appear that is

1:27:54.320,1:27:58.080
Yeah, we're just getting rid of these wood arrows

1:27:58.080,1:28:13.360
and collecting some deer meat because we 
need some. There is an A-frame up ahead.

1:28:13.360,1:28:28.000
I've got to think that we overlooked an 
A-frame somewhere in that other land.

1:28:28.000,1:28:31.120
This is not the A-frame you're looking for.

1:28:33.920,1:28:50.560
You can go about your way.

1:28:50.560,1:29:00.080
And this definitely isn't the 
A-frame you're looking for.

1:29:15.040,1:29:26.080
Somebody's tearing something up. Oh, it's a 
stupid bear. I swear there are too many bears.

1:30:18.800,1:30:45.280
Why is it when I was dear 
They were so hard to find.

1:31:47.120,1:31:53.360
That sounds like a troll.

1:31:53.360,1:32:03.200
Not seeing him though. Oh, there 
he is. Boy, they blend right in.

1:32:03.200,1:32:11.600
You'd think that blue would just stand out like 
a sore thumb, but pretty easily overlooked.

1:32:51.680,1:33:02.720
Oh, right on the edge of the black 
forest. That was almost overlooked.

1:33:02.720,1:33:07.200
Hard to get into, too.

1:33:10.800,1:33:28.320
Not it.

1:33:28.320,1:33:33.360
Not chasing after you.

1:34:10.000,1:34:12.400
Yeah, I thought this was a small island.

1:34:16.160,1:34:40.480
I'm sure we've read it, but let's 
check it. Astrid again. Shield maiden.

1:34:49.280,1:34:54.000
And that looks like Black Forest. So, 
what do we find out? Maybe this half

1:34:54.000,1:35:00.800
is Black Forest. What we got over 
here? Black Forest Meadows. Oh,

1:35:00.800,1:35:09.600
you dog. All right, we're going 
to finish this section out first

1:35:09.600,1:35:18.000
and then we'll take the boat over to 
the other side. See how big it is cuz

1:35:18.000,1:35:26.240
we're going to need the boat to get around anyway.

1:35:55.680,1:36:06.640
Nope. More buildings here. All right, I give up.

1:36:06.640,1:36:23.840
You guys chased me too far.

1:37:29.600,1:37:46.080
I'm trying.

1:38:13.200,1:38:14.720
Wicked.

1:38:29.840,1:38:39.440
This is so cool.

1:39:29.360,1:39:35.360
Well, we didn't find much there.

1:39:35.360,1:39:43.920
We've been here and we haven't found 
much in the way of meadows there.

1:39:52.320,1:40:01.280
We haven't searched this 
area, which we could do from

1:40:01.280,1:40:10.000
from here. It's a long way. Let's 
get the boat and let's let's

1:40:10.000,1:40:19.680
sail over here and see. Cuz

1:40:19.680,1:40:25.520
that tip is meadows. That's tiniest

1:40:25.520,1:40:38.160
tiniest meadows in the world. It doesn't 
seem like it's a good time, good use of time.

1:40:48.000,1:40:57.760
tiny bit right there that we haven't done, 
but I don't think that's going to be it.

1:40:57.760,1:41:02.800
That's been done.

1:41:02.800,1:41:05.920
Most of that's been done.

1:41:08.080,1:41:13.120
We did that around Hill Deere.

1:41:13.120,1:41:24.640
Wow. I almost got to think 
uh this area right here.

1:41:24.640,1:41:31.760
Well, got dark while we were 
staring at the map, didn't it?

1:41:39.680,1:41:54.080
Yeah, I should just start it this way every time.

1:42:04.400,1:42:21.120
Just start with the hoe and be done with it.

1:42:45.520,1:42:58.960
It's a lot bigger treasure hunt 
than I really ever wanted to go on.

1:42:58.960,1:43:13.360
Quite elusive this uh mysterious axe head.

1:43:13.360,1:43:21.840
Once we land, I think uh once 
we find a new meadow to search,

1:43:21.840,1:43:27.920
it's probably where we're going to stop this day,

1:43:27.920,1:43:37.840
this this episode. Not this day.

1:43:37.840,1:43:46.880
We got some stone over here somewhere. 
I'm sure we do. Not seeing it. I'm

1:43:46.880,1:43:55.200
going to drop three because I only 
want to carry as many as I have to.

1:44:20.000,1:44:23.440
dropped it on land again. Got it.

1:44:54.000,1:44:59.920
All right, we're actually facing the 
right way to begin with. Sail around

1:44:59.920,1:45:17.680
this tip and then let's head straight 
across here and see if we spot any land.

1:45:17.680,1:45:22.000
Just don't tell me that's going 
to be sailing into the wind.

1:45:24.560,1:45:50.480
Okay, it's going to be sailing into the 
wind. And I told you not to tell me that.

1:45:50.480,1:46:14.080
We're going to go this way. 
Just enough to pick up the wind.

1:46:14.080,1:46:18.400
Which, you know, we're going 
to have to turn eventually, but

1:46:23.680,1:46:31.440
With the wind shifting now, 
let's go ahead and head this way.

1:46:31.440,1:46:37.680
And that's what we were hoping for,

1:46:37.680,1:46:43.440
a favorable wind.

1:48:14.240,1:48:19.440
Some rocks up ahead.

1:48:19.440,1:48:32.640
Oh, we better swing out a little bit.

1:48:36.400,1:48:56.960
Just a little bit more.

1:48:56.960,1:49:00.480
Big old troll fish down there.

1:49:16.800,1:49:25.680
We could turn a little bit. 
Yeah, we're we're on good course.

1:49:25.680,1:49:29.280
Look at that rock sticking up out in 
the middle of the ocean like that.

1:49:29.280,1:49:40.480
Just wait to take out the bottom of your 
boat. Is that another one or was that a fish?

1:49:40.480,1:49:48.800
Those are fish. All right,

1:49:48.800,1:49:55.360
let's go ahead and swing out a hair

1:49:55.360,1:49:59.040
cuz we're going to Looks like 
we're heading into that point

1:49:59.040,1:50:06.880
right there and we want to 
miss that by a good layout.

1:50:26.800,1:50:31.520
We've got that land

1:50:31.520,1:50:40.800
to port. Maybe we should check it out.

1:51:05.680,1:51:11.920
I kind of wish I'd brought the big 
boat, but carrying it in a portal

1:51:11.920,1:51:17.360
have to just about drop everything else.

1:51:28.160,1:51:40.160
Tell me that's meadows and not the plains.

1:51:40.160,1:51:44.560
Looks green enough to be meadows.

1:51:48.800,1:52:04.880
Yeah, let's pull over there by those trees.

1:52:04.880,1:52:10.560
There's a small A-frame already.

1:52:32.960,1:52:37.280
It's a little early to

1:52:37.280,1:52:42.880
be on land. Come on.

1:52:42.880,1:52:46.800
All right.

1:53:17.360,1:53:26.320
I really need to get faster at that. I am not 
anywhere near where I need to be if I was going to

1:53:28.080,1:53:46.160
Save my butt in trouble. Save my butt 
when I'm in trouble. Something like that.

1:53:46.160,1:53:51.840
We got extra deer hide.

1:54:02.640,1:54:12.640
There's the nails. Uh, don't 
give me a heart attack like that.

1:54:19.040,1:54:30.480
Maybe we'll get really lucky and find Aldor 
while we're here. That would be so nice.

1:54:30.480,1:54:36.000
And I could really use a change of luck because 
I thought this was going to be maybe one,

1:54:36.000,1:54:42.320
two episodes and show off the early 
axes and get back to silver mining.

1:54:42.320,1:54:47.840
And we're getting like way 
off course with this quest.

1:54:47.840,1:54:57.120
not where I wanted to be. But now that 
I've started, I am determined to finish

1:54:57.120,1:55:06.240
because I'm just that bullheaded.

1:55:06.240,1:55:15.920
Well, it's an A-frame. It's more of a lean tooth. 
Let's be honest. It's not much of an A-frame.

1:55:18.640,1:55:31.440
All right. Well, we'll follow the 
coastline and we should grab our portal.

1:55:31.440,1:55:44.320
So, let's go get the portal. Running 
off without the raincoat again.

1:55:47.760,1:55:51.040
And don't ask me, I'm not even 
sure that is an old saying,

1:55:51.040,1:55:56.880
but it sounds like an old saying my 
grandpa would have said whenever he

1:55:56.880,1:56:05.360
was doing something too quickly and 
not making sure he was ready to go.

1:56:05.360,1:56:10.240
It's the reason pilots have checklists.

1:56:10.240,1:56:12.560
Run through the list of everything you're supposed

1:56:12.560,1:56:37.920
to do. Before you start something 
that could get your butt in a sling.

1:56:37.920,1:56:40.880
Gotcha.

1:56:48.080,1:57:05.440
Little anticipation and a whole lot of luck.

1:57:31.920,1:57:41.120
True guar.

1:57:41.120,1:57:53.920
No chest. All right. forgot to be 
marking them off, but here we go.

1:57:53.920,1:58:05.920
A house, but not an A-frame.

1:58:05.920,1:58:11.040
Not seeing a chest in there either way.

1:58:16.880,1:58:23.360
This looks like an A-frame,

1:58:23.360,1:58:36.240
but it looks like it's missing the chest. 
Okay. Couple of buildings we didn't mark.

1:58:42.720,1:59:02.080
Let's do this one. Head back to a coast.

1:59:35.120,1:59:37.840
There we go.

1:59:40.080,1:59:49.200
Well, if nothing else, we'll get 
a little deer meat out of this.

1:59:49.200,1:59:55.440
And we're at the Black Forest. So,

1:59:55.440,2:00:02.960
ah, another mountain, I do believe.

2:00:42.000,2:00:51.520
Got a little pond here. Yeah.

2:00:51.520,2:01:01.200
Little deer stand.

2:01:03.200,2:01:22.800
Oh, you moved just in time.

2:01:42.960,2:01:48.400
Not this time.

2:02:02.800,2:02:13.920
All right, let's uh pitch chat here.

2:02:34.080,2:02:39.920
And I think that's where we're 
going to wrap this episode up.

2:02:39.920,2:02:55.440
It looks like we will be on episode four 
or five of the search for the a early axes.

2:02:55.440,2:03:04.640
Be curious to hear your thoughts on 
what you think of the search. Frankly,

2:03:04.640,2:03:10.480
I think it's getting a little boring. Oh, what 
do we got here? wood arrows and flint arrows.

2:03:10.480,2:03:22.640
Okay. And we're working on those flint arrows. 
And up here we've got 200 flint arrows and 100

2:03:22.640,2:03:34.560
iron head and a handful of poison arrows. I find 
in almost every one of my games I end up with huge

2:03:34.560,2:03:46.000
stacks of all of these and I'm always trying 
to get rid of them because fire arrows seem

2:03:46.000,2:03:58.960
to be the go-to for most situations. Not all, but 
most. All right, let's uh don't forget to repair

2:04:01.520,2:04:05.840
every time we get back to base.

2:04:05.840,2:04:11.600
We should do that.

2:04:11.600,2:04:22.000
Next time we'll start out going to sleep and 
then continue the search for early access.

2:04:22.000,2:04:28.400
Next time, part four. Thanks y'all. 
I'm Grandpa. We're playing Valhunt.
