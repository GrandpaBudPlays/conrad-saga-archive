## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
Before a warrior can master the land, he must understand the forces that govern it. Conrad begins this chronicle by peering into the very fabric of the world—the modifiers and laws that dictate his exile.

Once the study is done, we return to the dirt. Day 8 is a journey of expansion: securing more golden honey, facing the sting of the wild, and treading carefully into the smallest shadows of the Black Forest. An old man knows that knowledge is a sharper tool than any flint axe. Valhalla favors the wise.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:03.440,0:00:11.920
Hey peeps. Uh this is uh Grandpa Plays Valheim. 
I'm Grandpa Bud and glad you could join us. Before

0:00:11.920,0:00:17.280
we get started, I thought we might just take 
a minute and look at the world settings. We

0:00:17.280,0:00:24.400
didn't spend any time on that when we started, but 
let's go ahead and uh jump into Conrad here. And

0:00:24.400,0:00:31.280
then we've been playing in Terara Conrad with 
just this random seed. But if we go in here to

0:00:31.280,0:00:38.640
world modifiers, this is where you can change 
the way the world behaves. So you can customize

0:00:38.640,0:00:45.520
combat. You can make that harder to very hard. 
We're running with all the defaults. The death

0:00:45.520,0:00:54.560
penalty is normal. I believe that means that we 
lose about 5% of our skill gain and any partial

0:00:54.560,0:01:02.080
skill gain would be wiped out when you die. 
You can adjust that as you want. Resource rate,

0:01:02.080,0:01:08.160
that's a nice one. If you're trying to play and 
you have limited time and you just bump this

0:01:08.160,0:01:15.280
resource rate up, it makes it a lot easier to 
get through things faster. You'll get more wood

0:01:15.280,0:01:22.080
when you chop wood. We haven't got into mining 
resources, but once you start mining resources,

0:01:22.080,0:01:29.760
you know, digging in the ground to take out 
minerals, uh, that'll come out faster. Raid rate,

0:01:29.760,0:01:34.960
we saw our first raid yesterday. Uh, this 
is where you can change that. You can bump

0:01:34.960,0:01:41.520
it up to more often, you can drop it down to 
much less, or you can turn it off completely.

0:01:42.080,0:01:47.520
You can see most of these worlds that I 
play in, I have turned that off almost

0:01:47.520,0:01:54.560
uh every world. I'm not real fond of raids, but 
for this one, we're going to stick with normal

0:01:54.560,0:02:04.240
uh and let you see how the game 
plays under the regular settings. Um

0:02:04.240,0:02:10.000
and then the other thing is portals. So, 
portals typically, we haven't got into that,

0:02:10.000,0:02:18.240
but we'll get into that once we start entering 
um the Black Forest and find out a few more of

0:02:18.240,0:02:24.560
the resources that are there for us. But portals 
allow you to jump quickly from one area of the

0:02:24.560,0:02:34.400
world to another. It's really nice because um cuts 
down on all that travel time. Uh but a restriction

0:02:34.400,0:02:42.960
on portals that is in the normal is that you 
can't carry certain minerals through the portal

0:02:42.960,0:02:50.080
and you have to travel with those minerals 
to get them back to your base. We'll get in

0:02:50.080,0:03:02.640
that in later biomes and we'll talk about it a 
little bit more. For now, excuse me, I cut off.

0:03:02.640,0:03:09.120
Sorry about that again. I'm tired of this cold. 
Anyway, we'll get into all the portal stuff a

0:03:09.120,0:03:14.880
little bit later in the game. Uh then you got 
different options here. No build cost means

0:03:14.880,0:03:20.960
that when you build something, you don't have to 
have the resource for it. Playerbased raids. Never

0:03:20.960,0:03:28.000
looked into what that is, but I think it's kind 
of obvious. Fire hazard. Wood can catch fire. Now,

0:03:28.000,0:03:36.480
you notice we built a wood chimney around our 
fire. I think what once that is turned on as

0:03:36.480,0:03:44.240
fire hazards, depending on how close that wood is 
to the fire, it can catch fire. Um, there's some

0:03:44.240,0:03:51.200
good things about that uh that you'll get into 
when you start needing to get coal. If you turn

0:03:51.200,0:03:58.560
on fire hazard, you can put a fire underneath a 
pile of wood and turn it into coal. Um, never have

0:03:58.560,0:04:04.560
turned it on. I usually try to stick pretty close 
to normal other than I like to drop the raid rate

0:04:04.560,0:04:12.080
down. Lately, I've been dropping portals down 
so that I can transport minerals. That kind of

0:04:12.080,0:04:18.560
breaks part of the intention of the game where 
the game developers want you to be able to want

0:04:18.560,0:04:25.440
to force you to travel uh especially via boat, 
which we'll see when we get to the later game.

0:04:27.040,0:04:33.280
But sometimes I've just gotten to the point where 
I play too much and I just don't have that extra

0:04:33.280,0:04:41.280
time. Passive enemies. We turn that on and nothing 
will attack us. We can walk around the world. No

0:04:41.280,0:04:47.520
map. If you really want a challenge, turn on 
no map. And you're going to have to get really

0:04:47.520,0:04:54.320
good at finding your way around without having any 
record of where you've been or where you're going.

0:04:54.320,0:04:59.920
Anyway, that's of the world modifiers. We're 
not going to change anything. We're going to

0:04:59.920,0:05:09.280
continue play playing just under the normal 
settings. And let's jump into Terra Conrad.

0:05:09.280,0:05:15.520
I think we ended on day six, so this 
should be coming up on day seven.

0:05:15.520,0:05:30.480
Want to cook a little deer meat before we 
start. And then we will uh go to sleep.

0:05:30.480,0:05:34.320
I tell you what, let's drop another spit on the

0:05:34.320,0:05:42.560
fire so that we can cook four 
foods at once. Maybe even six.

0:05:47.040,0:05:54.240
get a little more efficient cooking that way. 
Later in the game, there's a larger spit. We

0:05:54.240,0:06:05.840
can cook larger pieces of meat and uh more 
meat at one time on a single spit. For now,

0:06:05.840,0:06:15.040
this is what we're going to have. and just kind 
of helps us get through this a little faster. Uh,

0:06:15.040,0:06:19.680
I wish I was cooking deer meat, which was 
my intention. There we go. We got some deer

0:06:19.680,0:06:26.800
ribs on there. I should have pulled that bore 
meat out or I should have put the meat into a

0:06:26.800,0:06:32.880
numbered slot and used a number slot so 
I could control what meat I'm cooking.

0:06:32.880,0:06:37.840
I think six of those will be enough. We'll 
put this in storage. Uh, and we're going to

0:06:37.840,0:06:53.200
eat deer and bore meat going forward for 
that higher protein mix. Higher health,

0:06:53.200,0:07:00.800
increase our longevity that way. All 
right, let's see what we can put in there.

0:07:01.360,0:07:10.560
Uh, want to keep out this until we get some 
honey. We're actually we're going to get honey in

0:07:10.560,0:07:20.000
the morning, I'm pretty sure. Going to need more 
storage. We're going through this storage quick.

0:07:20.000,0:07:30.880
Stack this stuff up. I want this with our food. 
And let's keep all of our trophies over here. So,

0:07:30.880,0:07:38.080
uh, we'll put this in. Get rid of that torch. 
Want to use up that most used torch to start

0:07:38.080,0:07:47.440
with. Put our excess deer meat in here. 
Oh, we've got honey now. That's great. Uh,

0:07:47.440,0:07:57.520
what else do we want to stick in here? There we've 
got some cooked meat in case something happens.

0:07:57.520,0:08:03.120
That's good for now. Let's get some 
sleep. Uh maybe drop a chest in that

0:08:03.120,0:08:12.640
other house so we don't clutter this one 
up. I can put some of the other torches

0:08:12.640,0:08:26.720
and our old stone axe that we don't 
use anymore. We'll put that over here.

0:08:26.720,0:08:37.920
Now, I want to keep this wood. Don't need 
all these torches. We do need those feathers.

0:08:37.920,0:08:44.560
And we can keep our We're not going to 
be accessing that right away. Just got

0:08:44.560,0:08:52.800
to remember that's here when 
we if we were to move bases.

0:08:55.600,0:09:07.120
Let's put the There we go. Going to need a 
lot of those. All right, let's run over to

0:09:07.120,0:09:12.480
that other beehive, which looks like it's 
straight that way. So, if we just head to

0:09:12.480,0:09:21.280
this bottom left corner of the mini map and keep 
heading in that direction, we should get there.

0:09:24.480,0:09:39.040
Try to pick up as many deer as we see along 
the way. Going to go around this big ravine.

0:09:39.040,0:09:45.360
We probably outrun that grine 
and he'll lose interest.

0:09:45.360,0:09:52.640
Oh, maybe we won't go around it. It's 
pretty pretty big. Great source of rock

0:09:52.640,0:10:01.920
on this hill. We could pick up 
a lot of stone if we needed any.

0:10:01.920,0:10:14.880
Oh, we found a another bore stone.

0:10:19.840,0:10:32.320
Well, he didn't lose interest.

0:10:32.320,0:10:35.920
Those graings really aren't 
much of a threat unless we

0:10:35.920,0:10:44.480
let our food run out and get caught by surprise.

0:10:44.480,0:10:54.960
Is this the same bore? Yeah. Is it land eat?

0:10:54.960,0:11:04.400
Yeah. Interesting.

0:11:04.400,0:11:08.880
I hear movement.

0:11:12.480,0:11:20.080
Let's get that shield out. So, two and three. 
We get our shield out. We use R. Put it away.

0:11:20.080,0:11:33.280
I think I've covered that before, so 
I'm probably just repeating myself,

0:11:33.280,0:11:42.720
but want to keep it put away so we are 
as efficient as we can be when we run.

0:11:45.520,0:11:51.440
I've heard the devs had an intention 
for these at one point that never got

0:11:51.440,0:12:02.080
implemented. Curious to see 
if they do anything with it.

0:12:02.080,0:12:11.520
Was that our bee house over here? That's 
not the one we marked. That one's over here.

0:12:14.480,0:12:20.160
I think I've got enough raspberries 
for now. Pick up some more later,

0:12:20.160,0:12:33.520
but right now I think got enough.

0:12:33.520,0:12:38.640
There's those bees. Oh, we got too close. You 
can see we're poisoned. We get that green glow

0:12:38.640,0:12:50.160
around us. our health starts dropping. Doesn't 
last long. And as long as we've got good strong

0:12:50.160,0:12:59.600
health bar from keeping up our eating, we're okay.

0:12:59.600,0:13:07.920
We'll just stand back at a 
distance. Take this guy down.

0:13:07.920,0:13:19.200
And sounds like that was it. There's our 
queen bee. Take a look in this chest.

0:13:19.200,0:13:23.520
Picked up a little more honey.

0:13:23.520,0:13:28.080
Got us some scrap wood. Got a little treasure.

0:13:29.760,0:13:37.760
We're not going to need that 
here. By the way, campfires,

0:13:37.760,0:13:50.160
uh, crafting tables, those kind of things will 
create a radius of about 20 m around them that

0:13:50.160,0:14:01.840
will stop creatures from spawning. Oh. Oh, I wish 
I hadn't killed him. He would that twostar boar.

0:14:01.840,0:14:11.280
That would have been great. Oh, look at all 
this wood. That twostar boar would have been

0:14:11.280,0:14:19.840
really nice if we could drag him 
back to our base and start breeding.

0:14:19.840,0:14:29.040
But he's dead. So,

0:14:29.040,0:14:39.840
I don't hear any bees in 
here. And there's no treasure.

0:14:39.840,0:14:46.160
Another beehive.

0:14:46.160,0:14:50.480
More bores.

0:15:04.560,0:15:13.280
Just going to do this like we have been doing 
it. Build his crafting table workbench. Tear

0:15:13.280,0:15:35.920
down the building with the beehive in it. 
Oh, got too close. Grab that queen bee.

0:15:35.920,0:15:43.760
Having trouble finding Oh, there we go. 
Couldn't find that structure. We tear the

0:15:43.760,0:15:57.760
building down. These vines stay in place. later 
in the game. Uh you're able to build these vines,

0:15:57.760,0:16:02.400
build, that's not the right word. 
You're able to grow them. You can

0:16:02.400,0:16:14.400
uh plant seeds for vines and grow more vines.

0:16:14.400,0:16:27.280
Maybe we can find some bones in 
this. That would be nice, but no.

0:16:27.280,0:16:31.760
Plenty of storage space. Got him a little excited,

0:16:31.760,0:16:44.400
but he's still there. Got him. And there's 
his friend. Little high. Little to the right.

0:16:44.400,0:16:55.680
Didn't get him. Little bit far for this crude bow.

0:16:55.680,0:17:01.680
Got him.

0:17:01.680,0:17:09.040
Got us another trophy. We're getting close 
to what we need to summon ether. Uh I think

0:17:09.040,0:17:15.200
that's the first time I've seen fish. Later 
in the game, we can get a fishing pole.

0:17:16.080,0:17:27.040
If you get really lucky, you'll find one in a 
treasure chest. Um, fish is a late game food.

0:17:27.040,0:17:31.680
Time consuming process to 
get your fishing skill up,

0:17:31.680,0:17:43.120
but it's kind of relaxing. Stand in the 
edge of the meadows, spend a day fishing.

0:17:43.120,0:17:47.680
Yeah. What's this guy want? Oh, let's 
take a minute here. We're going to use

0:17:47.680,0:17:54.720
our shield to block this guy and see if 
we can get a parry bonus with it. There

0:17:54.720,0:18:04.400
we go. And you saw him stagger. And then we 
got our stagger bonus. So, we've got that

0:18:04.400,0:18:11.520
um parry bonus of one and a half with the 
wood shield. Uses generates an adrenaline

0:18:11.520,0:18:17.840
of five. We'll get into that once we take 
a look at trinkets. Uh, but that one and

0:18:17.840,0:18:26.800
a half damage that that can really shorten a 
fight with a tough opponent. It's one one of

0:18:26.800,0:18:38.320
the best ways to take down those trolls is if 
you can parry them. Yesterday, I guess it was

0:18:38.320,0:18:46.560
a couple days ago, we saw that troll when 
we approached the edge of the Black Forest

0:18:46.560,0:18:54.640
and he was carrying a log as a weapon. 
So, there's two different types of

0:18:54.640,0:19:00.960
trolls in the Black Forest. One that 
carries the log and one that doesn't.

0:19:02.480,0:19:18.560
I find the ones that carry the 
log are much harder to fight.

0:19:18.560,0:19:22.080
All right, looks like we should 
be heading for home. We've used

0:19:22.080,0:19:28.560
up our rested bonus. We're in the rain.

0:19:32.720,0:19:41.200
We had five stone on us. We could just look at uh

0:19:41.200,0:19:55.680
making a temporary fire. I kind of 
hate running back to base every day.

0:19:55.680,0:19:57.840
Come on, don't run away.

0:20:06.320,0:20:11.200
Perry makes a fight so much easier. Oh, 
we got lucky on this one. And we do have

0:20:11.200,0:20:22.960
some more bones. I think we needed was 
it three? Three more piles of bones.

0:20:22.960,0:20:27.120
Any chance this house doesn't have a bee in it?

0:20:33.280,0:20:41.600
It's got a rock in it. I think I hear a bee, 
but I don't Oh, yeah. There's a beehive.

0:20:41.600,0:20:46.080
All right. Oh, and there's the 
edge of the black forest. That is

0:20:46.080,0:20:54.880
one of the smallest black forests I've ever seen.

0:20:54.880,0:21:02.640
Look at that. I wonder if we can 
actually enter the black forest here.

0:21:02.640,0:21:09.920
There we go. That's the announcement that we have 
entered a new biome. We only see that once. Oh,

0:21:09.920,0:21:15.040
and there's Hugan wanting to talk 
to us. Where'd he go? Where are you,

0:21:15.040,0:21:29.760
Hugan? I heard I saw the words. There he is. What 
do you say, bird? This is a dangerous place. Well,

0:21:29.760,0:21:37.440
if the black forest isn't any bigger than that, 
it's not that dangerous. And we do need to make

0:21:37.440,0:21:49.520
sure we are prepared. And he thinks we're 
unprepared. He could be right. Oh, now what?

0:21:49.520,0:21:58.000
Rumor has it some traders have 
found themsel Are we near the trader

0:21:58.000,0:22:03.040
if you find yourself you need 
special commodities seek them

0:22:03.040,0:22:07.680
out. So when you get close enough 
thank you Hugan appreciate that

0:22:07.680,0:22:18.000
info. Once you get close enough it will 
drop a icon for the trader on your map.

0:22:21.680,0:22:33.440
Never hurts to carry five stone with you. So if 
you want to make a quick camp, you've got it.

0:22:33.440,0:22:39.600
You got the stones to do it.

0:22:44.320,0:23:07.600
He wasn't paying attention 
and did not see us coming.

0:23:07.600,0:23:15.200
I'd kind of like to just keep exploring.

0:23:15.200,0:23:34.720
We got enough wood. We should be able to make it.

0:23:34.720,0:23:47.760
Oh, you surprised that when we 
parried him that we didn't kill him.

0:23:47.760,0:23:59.360
Well, there's another house back here, 
wasn't there? Besides just this one.

0:23:59.360,0:24:04.880
And we're not eating. Look how low we let 
our health get. Down to nine hit points.

0:24:10.000,0:24:24.960
That's really I'm really bad about that. And that 
is the fastest way you can die in this world.

0:24:24.960,0:24:28.400
Well, we're headed in the general 
in the general direction of home.

0:24:28.400,0:24:40.080
But if we can grab one of these houses, I think 
I might just drop a bed down and stay here.

0:24:40.080,0:24:43.600
All right.

0:24:43.600,0:24:48.800
So, we're not going to get a fire 
to stay lit in this rain, unless,

0:24:48.800,0:24:57.520
of course, we put a roof over it. And we 
can't do that without a crafting table.

0:24:57.520,0:25:04.960
We don't have to put it inside, 
but just kind of have it

0:25:04.960,0:25:12.240
in case we want to repair.

0:25:12.240,0:25:18.000
Now, let's put a roof over 
this fire so it's protected.

0:25:18.000,0:25:24.480
Doesn't really take much. Just keep 
the rain off of it. There we go.

0:25:24.480,0:25:30.720
Now, that might be close enough that it would 
catch fire if we had that option turned on,

0:25:30.720,0:25:36.000
but we don't, so we don't have 
to worry about it. Let's cover

0:25:36.000,0:25:50.320
this roof up. That's a 26. We need a 45. 
There we go. Going to drop a bed down.

0:25:50.320,0:25:58.480
We're not going to abandon our base. 
But this will be a great temporary

0:25:58.480,0:26:03.280
spot to end the day with here.

0:26:03.280,0:26:08.960
Get that rested bonus. And let's let's wait

0:26:08.960,0:26:22.240
till it's night time. See what 
else it's in the general area.

0:26:23.360,0:26:32.400
Oh, I should have had my bow out. I thought 
he was a boar when I was coming up behind him.

0:26:32.400,0:26:41.040
His friend is here. I heard him.

0:26:41.040,0:26:46.720
There he is.

0:26:56.080,0:27:08.800
We've got seven deer hide on us 
and I think we have 12 back at the

0:27:08.800,0:27:16.400
back at the house. So, we're 
getting close to enough

0:27:16.400,0:27:24.160
deer hide to create some leather armor. We 
could go ahead and probably create another

0:27:24.160,0:27:33.440
piece of armor and replace this 
rag armor with something leather.

0:27:33.440,0:27:40.320
Just hunting out these abandoned 
buildings for uh precious resources.

0:27:41.280,0:27:55.120
No chest in here. Oh, but a grine.

0:27:55.120,0:27:59.440
Don't want to venture too far away from our base,

0:27:59.440,0:28:06.800
which I think is in this general 
direction. Didn't mark it, so

0:28:06.800,0:28:09.200
not completely sure.

0:28:12.720,0:28:19.440
Be nice if we could spot that 
fire. There's the smoke in the air.

0:28:19.440,0:28:23.840
There's the smoke.

0:28:23.840,0:28:31.760
Nope, that's a tree.

0:28:39.360,0:28:46.160
This must be the one with the B,

0:28:46.160,0:28:53.760
whichever. It's not the one we started using.

0:28:53.760,0:28:58.800
Where is that house? That was not 
very bright. Now we're going to be

0:28:58.800,0:29:11.600
running around in the night looking for a place to

0:29:11.600,0:29:17.520
sleep. Now it's night time.

0:29:17.520,0:29:24.800
World gets a little more dangerous. 
But I see our fire light.

0:29:24.800,0:29:26.560
Let's go to sleep.

0:29:30.720,0:29:37.280
Hey everybody, thanks for joining. I'm Grandpa 
Bud. We're playing Valheim. Appreciate you

0:29:37.280,0:29:42.000
uh joining. And I think we'll 
wrap it up for today right here.
