## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
A new dawn breaks over the 10th World. Conrad spends the morning at the hearth, reflecting on the lessons the Allfather has already provided. The Meadows are vast, but the call of the Black Forest is growing louder.

In this chronicle, Conrad shares the wisdom of the stones and the secrets of the map—knowledge earned from a lifetime of survival. We push further into the wilds to find another altar of the Elder and prove that even an exiled man can find his way through the dark. The journey is slow, the thoughts are deep, and the weapons are getting sharper.
