## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
The trial is long, but Conrad’s patience is longer. In this chronicle, the exile pushes the very boundaries of the land—taming the wild boars of the Meadows and braving the dark burial chambers of the Black Forest.

From the slow, steady work of animal husbandry to the adrenaline-fueled terror of outrunning a Troll in the dark, an old man knows that survival is a game of endurance. Valhalla is watching, and every Surtling Core found is a step closer to the forge.

Conrad’s trip into the Black Forest was a gamble that paid off in bone and fire. While an old warrior doesn't always show his excitement on the outside, finding enough Surtling Cores to build the kiln is a victory that echoes all the way to Valhalla. The pulse stays steady and the heart is ready for the work ahead.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:02.800,0:00:11.600
Well, good morning. Welcome back. I'm Grandpa 
Bud and we're playing Valheim. Going to go for

0:00:11.600,0:00:19.440
a little longer recording today. Um, initially 
I thought I'd try to keep these around 30 to

0:00:19.440,0:00:24.640
45 minutes. That is starting to feel 
really limiting ending at the end of

0:00:24.640,0:00:31.040
every day in Valheim. U just not making a lot 
of progress. It's going to go for uh an hour,

0:00:31.040,0:00:37.440
hour and a half, maybe two hours today. See how 
that feels. Um it's going to definitely make

0:00:37.440,0:00:44.960
a longer recording. All right. Uh we ended 
we stopped at night and it's raining. Let's

0:00:44.960,0:00:50.800
uh go to sleep. Hopefully in the morning 
there's rain stopped and we can continue

0:00:50.800,0:00:58.000
to explore sunny meadows in Valheim. Love 
these dreams. They're always kind of fun.

0:01:02.560,0:01:06.640
Oh, look at that. We woke up 
outside of the house. That's

0:01:06.640,0:01:16.160
hilarious. Day nine in Valheim. 
The door's on the other side, bud.

0:01:16.160,0:01:20.720
Let's make sure we got everything 
repaired. Crafting station is too

0:01:20.720,0:01:26.400
exposed. That's really hard 
to believe. Is it repairs?

0:01:38.320,0:01:43.920
What is killing the boores out there? We 
can hear them screaming. That's usually

0:01:43.920,0:01:50.480
when they're dying. All right, I think 
maybe the crafting station is poking out

0:01:50.480,0:02:00.000
through the wall. It doesn't look like it is. 
Let's tear it down and let's set it up again

0:02:00.000,0:02:07.120
and see if we get a different result this time.

0:02:07.120,0:02:17.760
That's better. Oh, we're getting 
attacked. Thank you. We needed bones.

0:02:17.760,0:02:24.640
Interesting. Why is there a skeleton in 
the area? That is really interesting.

0:02:24.640,0:02:32.640
We don't typically see a lot of skeletons 
in the meadows. We can certainly use his

0:02:32.640,0:02:39.760
bones. That'll go into our troll hide cape 
and maybe some of our other troll armor.

0:02:41.040,0:02:48.240
Um, so re-watching the video, I like to re-watch 
these videos at the end of the day to see how

0:02:48.240,0:02:55.520
bad I'm doing. Maybe make some small improvements. 
This is by no means a professional setup. I am not

0:02:55.520,0:03:03.680
a professional streamer. I'm not a professional 
YouTuber. I'm just out here trying to learn more

0:03:03.680,0:03:09.200
about what I can do with my computer. I loved 
playing Valheim and I thought I'd share that.

0:03:09.200,0:03:15.280
If you enjoy watching the videos, that's great. 
If you don't care for them, that's great,

0:03:15.280,0:03:22.000
too. Um, nobody says you have to like this, 
and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't,

0:03:22.000,0:03:35.760
because frankly, I think I'm kind of boring. But 
I'm enjoying doing it, and that's why I'm here.

0:03:35.760,0:03:48.720
Wow. Everybody wants a piece of us today. 
Oh, come on. Come here. There's that parry.

0:03:48.720,0:03:54.880
Haven't monetized this uh at all. 
It's just uh at this point it's just a

0:03:54.880,0:04:03.360
um just fun for me to try out see what I can do.

0:04:09.360,0:04:18.400
So, this today we're just going to continue 
exploring. Like to get um to see the extent

0:04:18.400,0:04:25.200
of the island, the continent, whatever you want 
to call it, that we're on. Uh typically I do

0:04:25.200,0:04:32.400
this by running along the coastline. Uh and 
we get a nice outline of our area on the map.

0:04:34.400,0:04:36.880
Uh, I wasn't listening, but it sounded like we

0:04:36.880,0:04:45.360
just passed up a deer. We should be 
hunting the deer while we're here.

0:04:45.360,0:04:57.440
We've certainly seen plenty of these 
stones. This one's a little different.

0:04:57.440,0:05:08.080
And oh, look at that guy. He's just 
standing there waiting for us to say hello.

0:05:08.080,0:05:16.480
Wow. The range on the crude bow is so low. 
Did you see how much that arrow fell? That

0:05:16.480,0:05:25.840
didn't That felt like a pretty close shot. And 
I still think we hit him down around the hose.

0:05:28.800,0:05:33.680
Looks like there's more ocean over 
there. We might be getting to the

0:05:33.680,0:05:40.240
end of this coastline in the 
direction that we're headed,

0:05:40.240,0:05:48.960
if that makes any sense. I'll bring up the map as 
we turn the corner here and show you what I meant.

0:05:52.560,0:05:59.120
So, haven't talked about this before, but 
uh the Valheim world is a procedurally

0:05:59.120,0:06:08.960
generated war world based on that world 
seed that you saw when we start the game.

0:06:08.960,0:06:18.160
And so, while each game has a lot of 
similarities, no two world seeds are the same.

0:06:19.200,0:06:27.680
If you were to copy the world seed from my video 
and use that as your world seed when you started,

0:06:27.680,0:06:33.040
you would be experiencing the same world 
I'm in. Otherwise, you're going to get a

0:06:33.040,0:06:39.920
completely different world. The land will 
have a different shape to it. The items in

0:06:39.920,0:06:46.800
the land will all be in different places. But 
the meadows, the starting area that we're in,

0:06:46.800,0:06:58.960
it'll always be boores and neck and deer, 
grings, the occasional skeleton as we saw.

0:06:58.960,0:07:06.880
And it's just randomly generated by

0:07:06.880,0:07:11.280
the algorithms the developer 
put into the world generation.

0:07:18.160,0:07:27.040
Thought I saw a mushroom over 
here, but I don't see it now.

0:07:27.040,0:07:40.720
But here's a nice mushroom patch. 
This is a long way from our base.

0:07:40.720,0:07:44.640
like that parry bonus. Practice 
your parries. They're going to

0:07:44.640,0:07:50.160
be invaluable later on when our 
opponents get tougher, especially

0:07:50.160,0:07:55.200
uh when we start seeing grey dwarfs from the 
black forest. They're going to be the first

0:07:55.200,0:08:05.520
thing that we encounter that we see a big jump 
in that are level threat level of the opponent.

0:08:06.960,0:08:20.240
So, we're starting to get the lands more broken 
up by water. Um, maybe we end up swimming between

0:08:20.240,0:08:23.840
islands, continents.

0:08:23.840,0:08:31.920
Let's go check out see if we get some new lore 
over here. Or is this the same old boar story on

0:08:31.920,0:08:58.160
this spot? The tree fell, man. Oh, yeah. Don't 
let the trees fall on you. They will kill you.

0:08:58.160,0:09:01.920
Let's take this guy.

0:09:04.560,0:09:17.760
No, don't move around on me. There we 
go. There another one there. I think so.

0:09:17.760,0:09:21.520
Not quite.

0:09:21.520,0:09:25.920
Scared him.

0:09:25.920,0:09:30.960
I I can't hit a rem moving target. I 
can barely hit a target standing still.

0:09:34.000,0:09:45.040
Uh there's an there's a once we get uh 
better materials, we can get a better bow.

0:09:45.040,0:09:52.000
All right. So, we're outlining this 
coastline. We're getting quite a ways from

0:09:52.000,0:10:00.000
uh our home. Not too far really cuz 
we've gone in kind of a big circle here.

0:10:00.000,0:10:07.680
And it looks like we built our home on this 
little tiny island and now we're exploring

0:10:07.680,0:10:16.800
this larger island which is taking us further 
from home. I wonder if we should run back.

0:10:16.800,0:10:25.920
See if we can do something. 
would really like to have

0:10:25.920,0:10:33.200
I'd really like to have one more 
two more bones so that we can

0:10:33.200,0:10:39.840
So that time you notice I just held the shield 
up, let him run into it. We didn't get a parry

0:10:39.840,0:10:45.440
bonus cuz we didn't time it. We just let him run 
into it. We still get the advantage of blocking

0:10:45.440,0:10:51.840
his attack with a little knock back. You saw 
him pushed him back a little bit when he hit,

0:10:51.840,0:10:59.440
but we don't get that additional damage from 
the parry. Haven't ever practiced blocking

0:10:59.440,0:11:08.080
bores before. Parrying bores. They don't have 
a a strong tail in their attack that I've

0:11:08.080,0:11:16.080
ever tried to keep up with. Oh, scared them 
off. But we've got some nice bore meat here.

0:11:18.800,0:11:25.520
Got lucky on that one. I didn't think 
I was going to get my shield out

0:11:25.520,0:11:34.960
in time. No, I'm not watching the food 
either. We're down one. Got lucky again.

0:11:34.960,0:11:43.680
That wasn't skill. That was just luck. All 
right, let's uh eat some of that honey.

0:11:43.680,0:11:49.760
We're four minutes away from the other food. 
We're so we're not really optimizing our use

0:11:49.760,0:12:06.320
on it. But I'm going to go ahead and eat it now 
while I'm thinking about it cuz I'll forget.

0:12:06.320,0:12:11.920
Boy, I'd love to find just one more 
set of bones before we head back.

0:12:16.400,0:12:22.160
Maybe we'll explore and we'll run home 
during the night. Be a little more exciting,

0:12:22.160,0:12:27.520
a little more dangerous. Um, there is 
a chance that skeletons will come out

0:12:27.520,0:12:35.440
at night and we can get some more bones that way.

0:12:38.880,0:12:45.120
I guess that's like a a Viking burial

0:12:45.120,0:12:50.080
is what this boat formation is. 
Don't have a digging tool yet. We

0:12:50.080,0:13:03.440
won't have that till we beat ether. So, 
not much that I know of that we can do.

0:13:03.440,0:13:05.280
Again, just running the coastline,

0:13:05.280,0:13:15.120
trying to outline the land so we've 
got a good idea what's around us.

0:13:15.120,0:13:24.160
Probably time good idea to gather some rocks for 
a fire so that we can We're not Oh, there we go.

0:13:24.160,0:13:35.840
Let's get a little closer to these guys. Oh, stop. 
I hit auto run. I want to get my stamina back.

0:13:35.840,0:13:44.000
Sneak up on these two.

0:13:44.000,0:13:51.600
That was good. All right, he 
ran off, so we'll let him go.

0:13:51.600,0:13:56.000
We're up to 11 deer hide. That's good.

0:13:57.680,0:14:16.400
I'm hitting R thinking I'm going 
to get my axe out and shield

0:14:16.400,0:14:25.840
and instead I'm just putting away 
my bow and getting it back out.

0:14:25.840,0:14:36.000
I wonder if we can get him back to the house. 
It's a long way. I'm carrying too much. Oh,

0:14:36.000,0:14:48.960
bad timing to be carrying too much.

0:14:48.960,0:14:59.600
I swear I hear bees. Do you hear a humming? 
Ah. There's a beehive here. Killed a deer and

0:14:59.600,0:15:03.520
we can't pick it up because we're carrying 
too much weight. So, what can we get rid

0:15:03.520,0:15:13.120
of? We can pull this onestar bore back to 
our house. He'll just keep following us.

0:15:13.120,0:15:20.160
Um, and then when we get there, 
we can put a pin around him.

0:15:22.080,0:15:33.680
This really takes a long time, but 
he'll just keep trying to kill us off.

0:15:33.680,0:15:39.200
We could outrun him. Uh, so we got 
to be careful about that. Did we

0:15:39.200,0:15:44.960
check this for bones? I don't know. 
But there doesn't appear to be any

0:15:44.960,0:15:54.640
here. Keep checking the mat. So, 
I'm going in the right direction.

0:15:54.640,0:16:04.880
There's a long way to drag this guy back. 
Can we get around this side? I think so.

0:16:04.880,0:16:15.600
Is he still with us? Yep, he's still 
there. Looks like we're good on health.

0:16:15.600,0:16:24.800
What's over that way? Another building over there.

0:16:24.800,0:16:30.800
If we can drag this onestar bore all the 
way back with us, that would be great. Oh,

0:16:30.800,0:16:39.360
not getting any of those. That's 
too bad. I wonder if he'll eat one.

0:16:39.360,0:16:46.080
All right, we're still going. Nope, that's 
the wrong way. We want to go this way,

0:16:46.080,0:16:50.080
right?

0:16:50.080,0:17:01.440
Yeah. Shadows are getting long. Uh 
we might be headed for nighttime.

0:17:01.440,0:17:09.760
Maybe we'll pick another boar up along the 
way and we'll have a two boar. So this guy,

0:17:09.760,0:17:19.680
this guy's a onestar boar. And when a 
one-star boar mates with a zero star boar,

0:17:19.680,0:17:27.760
there's like a 30 to 50% chance. Oh, he's going 
to come at us that way. All right. There's a 30%

0:17:27.760,0:17:34.320
chance the offspring will be a onestar boar. 
Maybe 50%. I can't remember the exact numbers.

0:17:34.320,0:17:47.840
Either way, we can start breeding one star 
boores because eventually we'll have another one.

0:17:47.840,0:17:50.080
Which way do we want to go? We want to cut through

0:17:50.080,0:17:59.280
this way to get to the house. See if 
we can speed this up a little bit.

0:18:02.480,0:18:08.800
Is he still with us? Yep. So, we're just 
going to try to lead him all the way back

0:18:08.800,0:18:14.800
to our house and then we're going to create a pin

0:18:14.800,0:18:24.400
was watching um videos last night on 
the dos and don'ts in Valheim. Really

0:18:24.400,0:18:29.040
interesting video. But one of the things 
he said was don't. Let's grab this other

0:18:29.040,0:18:39.280
bore and then we'll have two. It's going 
to make it a little harder on us. But

0:18:39.280,0:18:45.920
what the heck? Do we still have the one 
star? Oh no, we lost our one star. Yeah,

0:18:45.920,0:18:52.880
I was afraid of that. Well, we're going to 
go ahead and head back to the house anyway.

0:18:54.560,0:19:04.480
Where did he go? I wonder if he got killed. 
What would have killed him? Anyway, that's

0:19:04.480,0:19:19.360
too bad. That's a long long way to bring him. Um, 
I was surprised he followed us as far as he did.

0:19:19.360,0:19:25.840
But what is all this about? Well, 
if we can start breeding boores,

0:19:25.840,0:19:36.320
we'll have an unlimited supply of boar meat 
and an unlimited supply of leather scraps.

0:19:36.320,0:19:44.160
And both of those are things that we're 
going to continue to use late in the game.

0:19:44.160,0:19:49.920
All right. Is the house Which side of this big 
ravine is the house on? I think it's this side.

0:19:49.920,0:20:00.800
And I think we lost our other boar. So, we ended 
up with no bores, so we won't be breeding. Um,

0:20:00.800,0:20:09.200
typically I don't start breeding this early in the 
game anyway, so it doesn't really bother me. Uh,

0:20:09.200,0:20:13.760
we'd be really lucky if we could have 
had a starred bore come back. Oh,

0:20:13.760,0:20:17.920
but the video I was talking about, 
oh boy, am I getting sidetracked.

0:20:17.920,0:20:27.120
Uh they said not to build next to your house. 
Probably because of raids would be my guess.

0:20:27.120,0:20:37.040
Um but instead have a secondary house away 
from Let's grab our honey. Oh, look. We've

0:20:37.040,0:20:44.400
got three in in the hive. Oh, we're not able 
to pick it up because of our weight limit.

0:20:45.920,0:20:51.360
Need some firewood. Oh, I don't want to 
put things on the fire. That's a problem

0:20:51.360,0:20:58.000
with putting multiple spits down is it gets 
harder to find your fire itself to add wood

0:20:58.000,0:21:08.960
to it. There we go. Now we are actually 
filling up this chest with meat. Oh,

0:21:08.960,0:21:13.360
maybe we'll need to have a good 
cooking session. Cook a bunch of it.

0:21:20.720,0:21:28.800
But we should be able to grab that honey now. 
So each beehive will continue to create honey

0:21:28.800,0:21:36.880
until there's four honey in the hive. About one 
a day, I think. So every every couple of days,

0:21:36.880,0:21:42.800
you want to empty that out. Don't let it fill up 
or you're not optimizing your use of the honey.

0:21:45.840,0:21:54.000
Um, if it gets to four, you're 
just wasting time by not

0:21:54.000,0:21:56.880
taking it out. Once you get enough honey,

0:21:56.880,0:22:06.160
it doesn't matter. But if you're trying to 
build up, uh, we got 50 scraps. That's good.

0:22:06.160,0:22:10.960
21. Let's take a look at what we can do 
in the morning. Let's get some sleep.

0:22:12.160,0:22:26.640
Uh, it's good to be home.

0:22:26.640,0:22:31.200
We're on day eight.

0:22:31.200,0:22:36.240
Not that it's a race. Day 10. I'm 
not I'm not ever worried. I don't

0:22:36.240,0:22:41.040
do any speed running. I'm not trying to get 
through this as fast as I can. Obviously,

0:22:41.040,0:22:47.520
I don't want the videos to drag out longer than 
they need to, but some of that's just the nature

0:22:47.520,0:22:53.120
of playing Valheim. It's It takes a while. 
It's something that you've going to have to

0:22:53.120,0:23:00.480
uh if you want to get to the final boss in the 
game, at least the final one that's been created

0:23:00.480,0:23:10.720
so far. It's going to take some time and uh 
dedication to the game. The bees are happy.

0:23:10.720,0:23:22.640
The end of the day, we should have our first 
honey. Going to drop some stuff off in here.

0:23:22.640,0:23:29.200
Uh, don't need to carry that old hammer around. 
Don't need to carry that glove around. We got

0:23:29.200,0:23:36.000
more wood than I typically carry around. Another 
thing I saw Oh, we got two bees. We got another

0:23:36.000,0:23:47.600
bee. All right. Um, another one of the dos 
and don'ts I saw in that video was don't put

0:23:47.600,0:23:52.000
wood in your chests. Now, if you have plenty 
of chests, I don't know if it matters to me.

0:23:52.000,0:24:02.080
It seems more efficient to put it in a chest. 
But I think his point is you can use your craft

0:24:02.080,0:24:15.200
your hammer and just create stacks of wood. Let's 
do that. Let's just take this 50 wood we have and

0:24:15.200,0:24:21.200
we'll come over here to the miscellaneous tab. 
We can create a pile of bones if we had enough.

0:24:22.080,0:24:30.160
And we can create a wood stack. We don't 
have 50 wood. Thought we did. Must have

0:24:30.160,0:24:38.400
used enough of it on our beehives. Did 
we check to make sure they're happy?

0:24:38.400,0:24:47.280
Looks like everybody's happy. Can't get them 
too close. That's why we do this spacing.

0:24:51.840,0:25:00.240
All right, let's see what we can uh 
do in the way of deer hide armor.

0:25:00.240,0:25:09.680
Ideally, we wanted that deer hide cape. We 
need five. I don't think we have five bones.

0:25:09.680,0:25:16.560
We've got four. We need one more bone. We got 
six deer trophies. I think we were keeping our

0:25:16.560,0:25:24.960
trophies over here. Or was it up here? Up 
here. Drop this guy in. We can hit place

0:25:24.960,0:25:35.600
stacks to put that in. Free up a slot down 
here. This is for our crafting materials. So,

0:25:35.600,0:25:43.520
I don't know. I spend way too much time 
organizing uh so I know what I've got.

0:25:45.440,0:25:57.440
Uh, I don't have five bones. We're going to have 
to work on that. Uh, what's it take for We've got

0:25:57.440,0:26:10.640
a leather helmet. That's just six deer hide. We've 
got rag trousers. And those rag trousers are armor

0:26:10.640,0:26:20.640
one. We could upgrade that to an armor too with 
leather trousers. We need six deerhide for that.

0:26:20.640,0:26:26.720
I wanted the deerhide cape, but we don't 
have the bones for it. Let's go ahead and

0:26:26.720,0:26:38.240
make some leather trousers. It's a small upgrade 
to our armor. Every little bit's going to help.

0:26:38.240,0:26:41.840
Put that back in the chest where we're got our old

0:26:41.840,0:26:51.840
equipment. And what do we 
need for a leather tunic?

0:26:51.840,0:26:53.520
Oh, we can have a leather tunic,

0:26:53.520,0:27:03.040
too. Six more of our deer hide. That leaves 
us with nine. There's our leather tunic.

0:27:05.360,0:27:10.880
Now, we've got a decision to make. I don't 
know if it's much of a decision. I think

0:27:10.880,0:27:15.040
I'll just go for it. Let's We could save 
this so that when we get enough deer hide,

0:27:15.040,0:27:26.000
we're ready to make a cave. But let's see if we 
can't go ahead and upgrade this leather tunic.

0:27:26.000,0:27:34.800
Take it from armor class of two to armor class of 
four. See, we're up to a nice armor class of six,

0:27:34.800,0:27:45.040
but we need bones for the leather tunic. We need 
bones for the leather trousers. We need bones.

0:27:45.040,0:27:52.480
So, we could spend a long time in the

0:27:52.480,0:27:58.480
let's see, leather helmet. And we need 
bones for that. Plus, we need upgrade to

0:27:58.480,0:28:08.240
uh station of three. We do have what we 
need to upgrade that shield. Let's do

0:28:08.240,0:28:14.480
that. We need some leather scraps. And 
did it say we need a resin? I should

0:28:14.480,0:28:23.680
have looked closer. Upgrade wood shield. 
Yes, we need resin. So, we've got plenty.

0:28:24.320,0:28:33.200
Let's go ahead and upgrade that. Let's upgrade 
the bow first. That That'll be a nice little

0:28:33.200,0:28:46.000
bonus. So, now we've got 8 to 16 damage with 
our current skill level. And where's bows?

0:28:46.000,0:28:51.440
I'm just looking past it, I'm sure. There 
it is. We're almost to skill level. Well,

0:28:51.440,0:29:00.320
we're at six and a half. We're almost 
seven. Let's upgrade that wood shield.

0:29:00.320,0:29:07.760
Takes us from block to 12 to 18.

0:29:07.760,0:29:11.600
Now we need a

0:29:11.600,0:29:19.200
upgrade the workbench to three to continue 
upgrading items. Our flint axe. We just

0:29:19.200,0:29:34.080
need flint. Let's upgrade the flint axe. 
That's not a bad bad upgrade to have at all.

0:29:34.080,0:29:41.600
And now we need a new workbench,

0:29:41.600,0:29:48.880
a new upgrade for the workbench in order to 
do that. Can't do the tunic. We're not going

0:29:48.880,0:29:56.480
to do the rag armor. We're going to put it 
away. Hammer. We can upgrade it. We're not

0:29:56.480,0:30:02.160
using it a lot. The only advantage in 
upgrading it is how often and how long

0:30:02.160,0:30:10.480
you can use it before it breaks. But let's 
just go ahead and do it while we're here.

0:30:10.480,0:30:17.440
Same with the hoe. We're not 
using those tools that much.

0:30:20.800,0:30:27.520
I was looking at what upgrades we could do. 
Leather rag hammer. We did leather helmet,

0:30:27.520,0:30:33.920
bones, hoe, leather trousers, rag trousers, wood 
shield. All right, we've got all the upgrades

0:30:33.920,0:30:45.680
we can do to our equipment. Let's look at 
what it takes to upgrade this workbench.

0:30:48.480,0:30:54.800
Sorry about that. Had to cough again.

0:30:54.800,0:31:02.960
I feel like I'm going downhill and not 
getting better. I don't know why that is,

0:31:02.960,0:31:10.160
but I'm sure we'll get better eventually. 
We need 20 leather scraps, 15 flint,

0:31:10.160,0:31:16.880
and five deer hide. All right. Do we have 
any of that stuff over here that we're

0:31:16.880,0:31:22.240
hiding from ourselves? No. There's our 
five stone we need for a fire while we

0:31:22.240,0:31:35.040
wander. We're going to put this extra armor in 
here. We need one more piece of flint. We need

0:31:35.040,0:31:41.600
We've got enough leather scraps

0:31:41.600,0:31:47.120
and we got enough deer hide. So, we just need 
one more piece of flint in order to make the

0:31:47.120,0:31:53.200
upgrade for that. We can upgrade the rest of 
our equipment. That's something that we're going

0:31:53.200,0:32:04.240
to work on. We're not going to go and make it a 
priority right now. I think bones is our priority.

0:32:04.240,0:32:09.840
Now, we can do something really 
risky. We can go back to where we

0:32:09.840,0:32:15.920
saw that troll. I think was right over 
here in the black forest on the edge of

0:32:15.920,0:32:23.280
where we discovered. And I think we saw a 
burial chamber in there. Burial chambers

0:32:23.280,0:32:34.960
are full of skeletons. So if we can go 
in there, get out of the black forest,

0:32:34.960,0:32:40.800
we will should have what we need.

0:32:44.400,0:32:51.760
in the way of bones and we'll probably pick up 
some additional treasure. Let's head over to

0:32:51.760,0:32:58.080
W's Edge. Grab the last piece of flint. Let's just 
grab several pieces of flint. And actually, let's

0:32:58.080,0:33:07.280
get it on the way back. One of the things I found 
when I go to these burial chambers is I end up

0:33:07.280,0:33:09.680
with more stuff than I can carry.

0:33:17.280,0:33:31.200
Okay, this uh beehive here, I wanted to show you 
another way to get it down rather than building a

0:33:31.200,0:33:37.680
Might as well get you while we're at it.

0:33:37.680,0:33:42.000
Another

0:33:42.000,0:33:47.600
way to get these bees out of the beehive 
rather than make a crafting station and

0:33:47.600,0:33:57.840
tear it down that way. Take our bow out 
and we're just going to shoot that beehive.

0:33:57.840,0:34:06.240
gets the bees all excited, but when it 
breaks, it still drops that queen bee

0:34:06.240,0:34:14.400
and the honey for us. And now, have we 
emptied this? Not yet. We can empty that

0:34:14.400,0:34:23.440
chest. Going to need that. That was handy. 
If we go into a burial chamber. Oh, not Oh,

0:34:23.440,0:34:34.560
god. Not eating again. and didn't get my 
bow out in time. All right, now we're at

0:34:34.560,0:34:38.400
Got a full tummy,

0:34:38.400,0:34:45.200
as my grandson likes to say.

0:34:45.200,0:34:49.360
Don't want to get the attention of 
that troll. Are we getting close? Yeah,

0:34:49.360,0:34:54.080
we're getting close to the black forest. 
There's a onear board. Decisions,

0:34:54.080,0:35:01.120
decisions. I'm going to try to take that one star 
boar back to the house again because that's what

0:35:01.120,0:35:07.360
we need to start. Now we're much closer 
to the house. We got a lot better chance

0:35:07.360,0:35:19.520
of getting him there. Come on, guy. Where'd 
you go? We We want to get at There you are.

0:35:19.520,0:35:26.880
Don't want to hit him. I want him full health 
for the whole ride. going to need wood to make

0:35:26.880,0:35:32.560
a pin. So, what we're going to do is we're 
going to head back and try to build a pin

0:35:32.560,0:35:43.680
around him as we go. And then we're going to 
feed him these mushrooms and try to tame him.

0:35:43.680,0:35:48.400
Not today.

0:35:48.400,0:36:00.000
We're close. We may just make this. We 
can get this guy, too, while we're here.

0:36:00.000,0:36:05.280
There we go. Two bores. We're not 
going to want that pin around the bees,

0:36:05.280,0:36:12.640
but we do want it fairly close to the house 
because we have to be around him for a good 30

0:36:12.640,0:36:22.480
minutes in order for it to tame. Okay, here 
we go. Let's see if we can make this pen.

0:36:22.480,0:36:29.760
Need a crafting station. He's going to beat 
us up while we're trying to do this. There we

0:36:29.760,0:36:42.240
go. Now go to the miscellaneous. Start 
on this pin. They'll keep finding us.

0:36:46.320,0:36:52.960
We can get the crafting station out 
of the tent pin at a later time. You

0:36:52.960,0:37:02.320
stay right there. We've almost got you pinned in.

0:37:02.320,0:37:08.880
Let's get on the inside of the pin 
because that's where we want the bores.

0:37:14.640,0:37:19.760
Get in here. Yeah, I need both 
of you in here. Those rocks are

0:37:19.760,0:37:25.680
messing with us. Let's uh let's extend this pin.

0:37:27.200,0:37:46.400
Hind to do this while you're 
getting attacked, but you know.

0:37:46.400,0:37:51.600
So, let's just put a door right there.

0:37:54.640,0:38:05.200
Open that door and let him in. 
Come on in. There's one of you.

0:38:05.200,0:38:16.480
Now, how are we going to get them 
both in? Let's build a chute.

0:38:16.480,0:38:19.840
We can take quite a few hits from 
him before we have to worry about

0:38:19.840,0:38:33.600
our health. Especially since we uh ate recently.

0:38:33.600,0:38:41.840
Put a door in that. And we're 
out of wood. Isn't that handy?

0:38:41.840,0:38:47.200
Oh, where could we grab some wood 
real quick? I really don't want to

0:38:47.200,0:39:01.760
lose him. Any chance we can just get him in here.

0:39:01.760,0:39:08.160
Point at the door. Close it. And we got 
them both. There we go. All right. What

0:39:08.160,0:39:13.280
we were going for here was a shoot where 
we can open one door, close it behind him,

0:39:13.280,0:39:18.240
and then open that door to get him in the 
pin. Luckily, we didn't have to do that.

0:39:18.240,0:39:35.600
Oh, we got a nice hole there. Um, hopefully they 
can't fit through it, but let's close that up.

0:39:35.600,0:39:40.800
There we go. Now, as long as we stand here, 
they're going to keep attacking. I'm looking

0:39:40.800,0:39:48.400
for a spot where there's a nice low spot 
I can throw stuff over. Going to throw

0:39:48.400,0:39:56.720
this food in there. They'll start taming. 
We're not going to stick around for that.

0:39:56.720,0:40:05.760
Jump in there. Grab that wood. Now, as long as 
they've got those exclamation points over their

0:40:05.760,0:40:13.520
head, they're not taming. So, we need to get 
out of sight and then they'll start taming. So,

0:40:13.520,0:40:19.840
we can just come over here. The other thing is 
they can't be within a certain distance of a

0:40:19.840,0:40:28.800
fire. That fire has to be visible to them. So, 
we don't have any wood, do we? We could build

0:40:28.800,0:40:35.840
something to hide the fire, but I I think we're 
going to be okay. what we want to wait for. So,

0:40:35.840,0:40:42.160
the exclamation points are gone over one of 
them. Now, you see little green hearts coming

0:40:42.160,0:40:49.600
up off of that one cuz he's eaten the food. Looks 
like they both have they both have green hearts

0:40:49.600,0:41:00.640
coming up. 30 minutes from now, if we stay in the 
area, they will be tamed. Uh later in the game,

0:41:00.640,0:41:05.920
we get a way that we can shorten 
that. And if there's two players,

0:41:05.920,0:41:13.280
having two players reduces the amount of time 
it takes to tame because it's 15 minutes each

0:41:13.280,0:41:22.320
instead of 30 minutes for one. And then if you 
have one of those items, it reduces taming time.

0:41:22.320,0:41:31.200
You can cut that time down even more by both 
of you having the items to reduce taming.

0:41:31.200,0:41:41.520
All right, we're just going to hang out. Um, 
since it's night time, we'll get some sleep.

0:41:41.520,0:41:49.280
Let's gather up our honey. 
He's not ready. He's not ready.

0:41:49.280,0:41:54.720
We've got another one. Uh, we've got 
no Well, we've got enough. We might

0:41:54.720,0:42:04.160
have enough wood. Where do we want that 
next one? Let's put him right up here.

0:42:04.160,0:42:10.720
And I like that little

0:42:10.720,0:42:14.960
little pole they're on.

0:42:14.960,0:42:21.280
And looks like we have enough wood to 
build this. So there's our new bee that

0:42:21.280,0:42:26.720
we used with the arrow method. Arrow 
method's a lot easier than having to

0:42:26.720,0:42:33.360
tear things down. when we first started this. 
I don't think I had my bow yet. All right,

0:42:33.360,0:42:40.080
we're going to go ahead and go to sleep. 
We're not going to worry about them taming

0:42:40.080,0:42:46.640
today um or anytime real soon. They'll 
just stay in that pin. If they get excited,

0:42:46.640,0:42:50.320
they will attack the pin. 
If they get excited enough,

0:42:50.320,0:42:56.560
they'll break the pin down. You want to 
check it and repair it every once in a while.

0:42:58.400,0:43:09.120
But having a one-star bore at this point 
in the game, this is the earliest I've ever

0:43:09.120,0:43:13.600
started taming.

0:43:13.600,0:43:24.400
Oh, I don't like traveling in the rain. We've got 
that wet debuff. Lowers our speed at which we get

0:43:24.400,0:43:32.240
stamina back. just slows everything down. Makes 
makes the envir Oh, look at that. There's the

0:43:32.240,0:43:44.880
black forest. We're going to skirts the outside 
of that. We don't want to get noticed right away.

0:43:44.880,0:43:51.280
I had no idea we were actually that close.

0:43:51.280,0:43:55.040
I really don't want to start a 
fight with anybody at this point.

0:43:56.160,0:44:03.680
There's some more bones. We've 
got enough bones for our cape.

0:44:03.680,0:44:10.320
But let's go ahead and see if we can't get

0:44:10.320,0:44:15.920
back to where we saw that troll. He's 
still going to be in the area. They

0:44:15.920,0:44:22.160
don't they don't wander too 
far from where you see him.

0:44:22.160,0:44:23.680
There he is.

0:44:28.560,0:44:36.400
I thought I saw him through there 
when the lightning flashed. Yep. So,

0:44:36.400,0:44:48.560
let's stay crouched and hidden. I 
want to see if I can get around him.

0:44:48.560,0:44:52.800
This is likely going to be 
our first death of the game.

0:44:56.480,0:45:08.640
Let my stamina run out. Fighting that bore 
will get make noise and get his attention.

0:45:08.640,0:45:14.240
I don't see. Yeah, he's right there. Going to be

0:45:14.240,0:45:20.640
really hard to get around him. 
Let's come out here to the edge.

0:45:23.600,0:45:29.680
Uh,

0:45:29.680,0:45:35.280
I'm not seeing what I wanted to 
see. Visibility is too low. But

0:45:35.280,0:45:42.960
I think right over the top of that rock there

0:45:42.960,0:45:49.520
was a burial chamber. He's over there. 
We want to be over there. This is risky.

0:45:50.320,0:46:01.520
I'm going to eat uh some honey a little early. 
Let's eat all of our food a little early.

0:46:01.520,0:46:08.320
So, we got maximum stamina. 
And let's try to swim across.

0:46:08.320,0:46:14.960
Haven't worked on our swimming 
skill. We're not very good at it yet.

0:46:14.960,0:46:22.320
Also, getting up on these rocks can be difficult. 
Having the water lift us up is a great way to do

0:46:22.320,0:46:36.320
it. All right, that's what we're seeing. That 
is not a burial chamber. That is a troll cave.

0:46:36.320,0:46:41.760
But there's three sets of bones at 
the entrance of that troll cave. As

0:46:41.760,0:46:46.400
long as we don't die swimming across this water.

0:46:49.440,0:46:55.280
early in the game for us to be entering the 
Black Forest. Oh, do you hear that gulp? That

0:46:55.280,0:47:08.320
was us. We start losing health when our stamina 
runs out. Now, there's probably a troll in here.

0:47:08.320,0:47:12.960
He will not come out.

0:47:12.960,0:47:21.840
But there's often a troll nearby like we just saw.

0:47:21.840,0:47:30.960
So, this is real early in the game for us to 
be in the black forest and it would probably be

0:47:30.960,0:47:39.360
smart to not be here, but I don't always play 
smart. Here we go. Here's some tin deposit.

0:47:39.360,0:47:48.880
That's one of the minerals that we'll be able 
to take out of the black forest. Over there,

0:47:48.880,0:47:56.720
we see that glowy. That's thistle, which is 
a nice ingredient for cooking. There's our

0:47:56.720,0:48:03.200
burial chamber. There's where we're 
going to get our source of bones.

0:48:03.200,0:48:07.200
We're going to have some tough opponents in there.

0:48:15.600,0:48:23.600
Hugenan's going to tell us about the 
burial chamber. He knocked us in,

0:48:23.600,0:48:33.840
which we can just turn around and head 
right back out. Let's get these bones.

0:48:33.840,0:48:51.440
One star skelly is going to be a little harder. 
We are really young for this, but we survived.

0:48:51.440,0:49:01.840
Yeah. All right. I I know I'm pushing it 
by doing this early this early, but to me,

0:49:01.840,0:49:10.880
that's the fun of this game. Push my limits. Okay, 
one of the things we can do while we're in here

0:49:10.880,0:49:23.520
listening to the nice creepy sounds, we can build 
a fire down here. Oh, don't bother me now. We can

0:49:23.520,0:49:33.520
build a fire down here and get our arrested 
bonus. Think I hear another one coming. Yeah.

0:49:38.720,0:49:47.920
Two of them over there. Three. 
Four. This could be bad. We're

0:49:47.920,0:49:56.400
losing too much health. Going to get out. Heal up.

0:49:56.400,0:49:59.360
Just hang right here.

0:50:01.120,0:50:12.480
let our health uh regenerate a little bit. I don't 
know if hiding does any good. So, the symbol there

0:50:12.480,0:50:23.120
that shows us uh sneaking. It shows that we're 
partially seeing uh something has noticed us. Now,

0:50:23.120,0:50:32.080
that flat line means nothing sees us. So, that's 
that's what we want. Hopefully, we can stay right

0:50:32.080,0:50:40.480
here, regenerate some of our health, and go 
back and take out the rest of those skeletons.

0:50:40.480,0:50:47.840
Dungeon exploration. That's 
That's a fun part for me.

0:50:47.840,0:50:53.520
One of one of the funnest parts of this game, 
though, I really like just the serenity. Uh,

0:50:53.520,0:51:00.080
after you get done in the Black Forest, going 
back to the nice, peaceful meadows. All right,

0:51:00.080,0:51:05.840
77 hit points. We could get a few more. 
84. Let's head back in. We don't want

0:51:05.840,0:51:14.480
to be hiding now. So, going to stand 
back up and enter the burial chamber.

0:51:14.480,0:51:28.480
Got our shield out. Got our weapon 
out. Where'd they go? There we go.

0:51:28.480,0:51:44.240
At this point, those archers are really scary. 
And the onestar skeleton. Whoa, too close.

0:51:44.240,0:51:49.760
All right, we're going to back out of here 
pretty quick. Uh, let's check this chest out.

0:51:51.280,0:52:02.480
Got a skeleton trophy. Those will come in handy. 
I think that's what we need for our first trinket.

0:52:02.480,0:52:09.840
Let's uh switch out. We'll put our uh 
torch in place of our hoe. It's nice to be

0:52:09.840,0:52:22.320
able to see while we're in here. Got some nice 
treasure. Ruby's a new item worth 20 gold. Uh,

0:52:22.320,0:52:29.520
this just keeps going. But I have a way 
that I like to go through the dungeons.

0:52:29.520,0:52:35.920
Um, so that I always am able to get my way 
out. All right, we want to get our rested

0:52:35.920,0:52:44.320
bonus. That's why we built that fire. Got to 
watch out for the smoked icon to make sure that

0:52:44.320,0:52:55.040
we're not being smoked out. I want that uh 10 
minute rested bonus that it's going to give us.

0:52:55.040,0:53:01.520
Probably rambling now. I just get 
excited about being in here. Oh,

0:53:01.520,0:53:10.000
and the spooky sounds. Oh, yeah. This 
is it. This is what it's all about.

0:53:10.000,0:53:19.200
Uh yellow mushrooms are decent. Uh stamina food. 
We gives us 10 health, 10 stamina. Not quite as

0:53:19.200,0:53:28.320
good as our Wait a minute. 10 and 30. Yeah. Eight 
and 35. More stamina, less health from the honey.

0:53:28.320,0:53:34.160
Um, this one's a little better balanced. Gives 
us 10 health. I'll stick with the honey. We're

0:53:34.160,0:53:39.200
going to need the stamina for some longer 
fights with these skellies. I think I hear

0:53:39.200,0:53:46.880
one behind this door. A little later, we'll 
get a weapon that'll let us actually do an

0:53:46.880,0:53:56.320
AoE that goes through the door. But for now, 
we've got to open this and start the fight.

0:53:56.320,0:54:04.480
Don't want that weapon. Got to put 
the shield down to hold the So,

0:54:04.480,0:54:12.080
he died from the uh fire dot. 
That torch, it's decent weapon.

0:54:12.880,0:54:23.440
But we're going to be using the axe. Clubs are 
fantastic weapon against skeletons because of the

0:54:23.440,0:54:30.320
uh damage type. Damage type itself more 
important. We need six wood for a club.

0:54:30.320,0:54:38.880
We can't do that. We could break one of these 
doors, but I think we'll get by with just the

0:54:38.880,0:54:57.840
um axe for now. Come on in here. 
Come on. No. No. Come in here.

0:54:57.840,0:55:05.840
Get that shield out. There we go. Get that parry 
bonus. That is the way we do this. This is a

0:55:05.840,0:55:13.120
skeleton spawner. That's a pile of skeleton bones 
down there. And skeletons will just keep coming

0:55:13.120,0:55:20.640
out of it. Uh that's why we want to attack those 
and take them out as quick as we can. Now, here is

0:55:20.640,0:55:30.720
the real treasure. Certling cores. Certling cores. 
going to unlock our smelter and our charcoal kiln.

0:55:30.720,0:55:38.960
That's what we need. We need five certling cores 
for to build one of those. And that's what we

0:55:38.960,0:55:50.320
need to convert raw minerals such as copper or tin 
into metal bars. And then with those metal bars,

0:55:50.320,0:56:00.560
we can craft much better items. Also, we want 
to talk about this guy right here. This veg

0:56:00.560,0:56:07.600
vvisor. I have no idea how to say that. Anyway, 
that's going to show us the location. It'll mark

0:56:07.600,0:56:13.840
it on our map of where the elder, who's the 
boss of the second biome, the black forest,

0:56:13.840,0:56:22.400
that's going to show us where he is. So, he's 
not too far from where we've been exploring.

0:56:22.400,0:56:30.000
I think when we got down here, we I don't 
know. We should go explore. See if we're

0:56:30.000,0:56:37.120
going to be able to walk to the elder or 
will we have to boat over to him. Anyway,

0:56:37.120,0:56:45.280
those now we know where the elder is. Let's get 
this last serpenting core. We've picked up 16

0:56:45.280,0:56:55.040
bones. We are in really good shape for why we came 
here. Again, it's a dangerous trip early in the

0:56:55.040,0:57:04.240
game. We don't even have upgraded leather armor 
yet, but this will speed along our process. Oh,

0:57:04.240,0:57:11.920
I want to back up real quick. Let's go back 
here to the first room that we came in. And I

0:57:11.920,0:57:19.280
want to talk about my method. You can do it any 
way you want, but I find that if I just come in

0:57:19.280,0:57:28.960
and take the first opening to the right, and then 
I constantly take the first opening to the right,

0:57:28.960,0:57:40.000
I will end up going through every room 
in the dungeon and find my way out. Okay,

0:57:40.000,0:57:47.520
here we go. Uh, let's put that 
away. Okay, let's get this out.

0:57:47.520,0:57:52.880
So far, we've encountered skeletons

0:57:52.880,0:57:58.640
in here and starred skeletons. 
We've got the sword variety,

0:57:58.640,0:58:11.120
the archer variety, the sword and 
shield variety. There's a couple other

0:58:11.120,0:58:20.560
more dangerous creatures that we'll find down 
here. I'm hoping we don't run into one. Boy, those

0:58:20.560,0:58:32.080
scary sounds while we're in here. Um cuz they make 
Oh, there's a spawner back there. You see that?

0:58:33.520,0:58:43.440
So, every time we kill a skeleton, that 
spawner is going to spawn another one.

0:58:43.440,0:58:50.400
We're out of stamina. Bad move on my 
part, but we got it destroyed before

0:58:50.400,0:58:59.840
he spawned another. And we've got another 
room with more certling cores. That gives

0:58:59.840,0:59:19.840
us five. We can now make the kiln and we 
can start the process of preparing for

0:59:19.840,0:59:23.920
uh sorry got distracted. we can 
start preparing for what's going

0:59:23.920,0:59:28.880
to come next where we want to start 
smelting ore and turning it into metal

0:59:28.880,0:59:39.600
ingots. And that'll take us from this stone 
age that we're in into the age of metals.

0:59:39.600,0:59:47.120
So that door is where we 
headed up. That's where the

0:59:47.120,0:59:51.280
can't pick that up. That's 
where the spawner was. So,

0:59:51.280,1:00:01.280
I think we finished this area. We're going 
to come down here, continue taking rights,

1:00:01.280,1:00:16.640
and I'm going to put away the torch 
so I can use my shield and axe.

1:00:16.640,1:00:20.880
Take advantage of that parry. I'm 
letting myself get bit beat up way

1:00:20.880,1:00:30.640
too much. I've got to take these things 
more seriously. Time to eat some honey.

1:00:30.640,1:00:36.400
Get that health bar back up.

1:00:36.400,1:00:40.880
Pick these yellow mushrooms.

1:00:40.880,1:00:57.920
Loot that chest. Keep exploring. Keep going. All 
right. Eventually, we'll double back on ourselves.

1:00:57.920,1:01:05.440
All right. We've got um a little bit of 
wood. We've got a little bit of resin. So,

1:01:05.440,1:01:14.160
we can make two more torches if we need to.

1:01:14.160,1:01:21.360
At this point, with how little how low our 
armor is, we've only got an armor class of six,

1:01:21.360,1:01:28.880
it's not a bad idea to put the torch away, get 
the Okay, back into the main room. There's the

1:01:28.880,1:01:38.160
entrance we came in. Um, get take advantage of 
that shield whenever we can. Usually, there's

1:01:38.160,1:01:44.720
another door right here. This time, it's blocked. 
Again, these are just randomly procedurally

1:01:44.720,1:01:51.360
generated dungeons. Uh, I'm amazed at what the 
devs have been able to do with their procedural

1:01:51.360,1:01:58.160
generation. I think they've done a great job with 
this. Um, again, I love this game. It's just a lot

1:01:58.160,1:02:08.800
of fun for me. Probably shouldn't turn my back on 
that hallway without seeing what's there first.

1:02:08.800,1:02:10.800
All right, let's get that axe out.

1:02:13.040,1:02:29.120
We emptied that. We came in here. We emptied 
that. No doors in here. No doors in here.

1:02:29.120,1:02:38.720
Just keep going right. Keep going right and we 
never get lost. All right. Haven't been in there.

1:02:41.120,1:02:51.760
Get the axe out. Our axe is u 3/4 
worn out. Good thing that we did that.

1:02:51.760,1:03:06.640
Notice we parried the arrow that uh 
staggered him. Gave us the bonus damage.

1:03:06.640,1:03:18.640
and um made that fight much shorter.

1:03:18.640,1:03:23.840
Looks like we've got a down, but let's 
go right. Looks like that's a dead end,

1:03:23.840,1:03:31.280
so that's fine. Take this downward slope.

1:03:31.280,1:03:35.520
Check around the corner. Nothing 
there. Let's get these mushrooms.

1:03:36.880,1:03:45.520
That's the end of that corridor. Head back up. I 
think we're getting a little close to the end of

1:03:45.520,1:03:55.920
here. Starting to double back on the places we've 
already been again. If we just always go right,

1:03:55.920,1:04:00.480
it's going to help us clear that dungeon. We get 
the resting bonus cuz we're getting close to our

1:04:00.480,1:04:09.440
fire. There's our fire. All right. Now, the fun 
part. It's probably nighttime. We've been in here

1:04:09.440,1:04:17.680
long enough that it's now going to be nighttime 
in the Black Forest. We're going to find ourselves

1:04:17.680,1:04:25.120
swarmed by grey dwarves. And we've got to get 
out of here without getting the attention. Let's

1:04:25.120,1:04:33.760
eat. Uh, six, seven. We got to get out of here 
without getting the attention of that troll. And

1:04:33.760,1:04:41.600
I'd rather not take on a bunch of gray dwarfs with 
our hammer as bad as it is. So, what we're going

1:04:41.600,1:04:50.160
to do, we're going to get out of this dungeon. 
We know that troll is in this general area right

1:04:50.160,1:04:57.360
here. Let's head straight for home. We're going 
to cross through this area of the Black Forest and

1:04:57.360,1:05:08.720
then uh hit the meadows and we should be home 
safe. So, we're going to run out of here. Um,

1:05:08.720,1:05:18.560
and see if we can get to safety. It's definitely 
night time. We feel cold. Double check that. We

1:05:18.560,1:05:26.800
want to go straight behind us. Put away 
our weapons so we got efficient running.

1:05:28.400,1:05:36.320
So dark. It's hard to see the obstacles in the 
landscape. Oh, come on. Where are we? We're out

1:05:36.320,1:05:45.440
of stamina. Oh, that's a gray dwarf spawner to 
the left there. That pink that we saw. Not good.

1:05:45.440,1:05:53.920
And we hit water. That's not what we wanted. I 
know where we are. I think we're back the way

1:05:53.920,1:06:07.040
we came in. So, we didn't really go the right 
way. We might get the attention of that troll.

1:06:07.040,1:06:12.800
We got a bear. I heard a bear. Don't want to 
fight a bear. I am not up to that. There's

1:06:12.800,1:06:21.120
that troll. Troll cave that we passed. We got 
a gray dwarf on our heels. We're going to try

1:06:21.120,1:06:30.320
to swim across here with that gray dwarf 
behind us. But we need we need our stamina

1:06:30.320,1:06:38.480
to make that swim. We almost drowned 
last time. Here we go. Go through the

1:06:38.480,1:06:44.400
shallows as far as we can. Put that weapon away.

1:06:46.560,1:06:59.440
Hopefully we don't get the 
attention of that troll.

1:06:59.440,1:07:07.520
Oh, a little further in than I thought. 
Okay, that's a that's the troll cave.

1:07:07.520,1:07:13.280
There's something going on over there where 
we saw that. It's probably that troll.

1:07:27.040,1:07:40.400
That is a grey dwarf shaman.

1:07:40.400,1:07:47.600
That's a grey dwarf. those little green 
uh particles in the air. That is a grey

1:07:47.600,1:07:56.640
dwarf shaman casting. Oh, there's 
that troll. He's on our heels now.

1:07:56.640,1:08:02.240
One hit from him and we're dead. I wouldn't 
be surprised if this is the end of us,

1:08:02.240,1:08:08.560
but let's see if we can get out of here.

1:08:08.560,1:08:15.360
He is right on our heels. 
You can hear his footsteps

1:08:15.360,1:08:22.640
little further back.

1:08:22.640,1:08:28.720
We're just going to keep running 
and hope that we get away.

1:08:28.720,1:08:33.840
What an adventure this has been.

1:08:33.840,1:08:39.200
All right, we don't want to lead him straight 
back to our house, but I think we're in the clear.

1:08:40.080,1:08:42.880
We're back in the meadows. We 
don't have the gray dwarfs on

1:08:42.880,1:08:53.040
our heels. I don't hear the troll behind us.

1:08:53.040,1:08:59.920
I think that was a very successful 
dungeon crawl. I'm so excited about

1:08:59.920,1:09:05.440
that. Look at that. We came out with 23 
bones. That's more than enough to get our

1:09:05.440,1:09:13.040
armor made. Here's our nice little 
beehives. There's our pin. See them

1:09:13.040,1:09:23.120
hearts coming up? Meaning that we're we're 
taming. No troll behind us that I can see.

1:09:23.120,1:09:35.760
Fantastic. Let's go to sleep. 
Welldeserved rest. Ah, my heart's racing

1:09:35.760,1:09:40.560
watching. I bet you that wasn't nearly 
as exciting as it was for me doing it,

1:09:40.560,1:09:49.440
but it was fun. That's why I play this 
game. All right. I think uh we wish we

1:09:49.440,1:10:00.160
had more deer hide. Now, what what to 
make first. Can we make the cape? Yes.

1:10:00.160,1:10:12.400
Repair everything first. We're going to 
make that cape. Fantastic. All right. Now,

1:10:12.400,1:10:24.400
we have met all the goals that we 
set out for the meadows. From here,

1:10:24.400,1:10:32.800
we could take on Ether. It'd be a tough fight.

1:10:37.120,1:10:50.640
But personally, I would like to see if we 
can't upgrade our leather armor to at least

1:10:50.640,1:10:55.840
Can we get to three? Well, we could at least get 
to two for all of our leather armor pieces. Right

1:10:55.840,1:11:02.160
now, we're at uh upgrade level one for each 
of these pieces of armor. If we could get to

1:11:02.160,1:11:13.200
do that would be much better. Get to can't talk. 
That's nothing new. I stumble. You know the funny

1:11:13.200,1:11:20.080
thing is listening to this I hear how heavy my 
accent is. Never realize it till you listen to

1:11:20.080,1:11:28.720
yourself. All right, let's cook some of this deer 
meat. We've got too much over here. Here's the

1:11:28.720,1:11:42.080
deer meat. I know what I'm doing. Surely I do. 
Let's cook the 11. It's going to take two trips.

1:11:42.080,1:11:47.920
We get six at a time.

1:11:47.920,1:11:52.480
We'll be able to knock this out 
in no time. And that's all bore

1:11:52.480,1:11:57.680
meat. I thought we put away the bore meat.

1:12:00.560,1:12:10.960
I just want to cook that. All right, 
we're going to have extra bore meat.

1:12:10.960,1:12:18.560
Just cook that until sometimes it gets caught and 
you got to step up there to get it out. typically,

1:12:18.560,1:12:24.720
and we haven't talked about auto pickup, but if 
you hit the letter V on the keyboard up there in

1:12:24.720,1:12:32.000
the upper left, it tells you auto pickup off, 
hit the letter V again, auto pickup on. So,

1:12:32.000,1:12:38.240
auto pickup is whenever you run across a 
resource that's been freed by hitting E,

1:12:38.240,1:12:46.880
you'll pick it up automatically. Or anything 
that is dropped by your kills. Um, but you see

1:12:46.880,1:12:59.280
how these ribs get stuck? We just got to get 
a little closer so that auto pickup kicks in.

1:12:59.280,1:13:03.600
So, not too worried about taming the boores. 
I'm not going to just hang out for that. I'm

1:13:03.600,1:13:08.640
going to let it happen naturally. We need to 
do some more deer hunting. We need more deer

1:13:08.640,1:13:15.120
hide for additional upgrades on our leather 
armor. Typically, I always have troll armor

1:13:15.120,1:13:24.320
when I fight ether. Um, I'm not not sure 
how that fight's going to go without it,

1:13:24.320,1:13:32.080
but I think we'll give it a shot if we can just 
get this up to two. Same time, let's scout out

1:13:32.080,1:13:39.760
the edge of that black forest so we know what 
it looks like. Um, well, actually, it looks to

1:13:39.760,1:13:47.520
me like we've got it all scouted out. It's right 
across the end of that. And um that's the end of

1:13:47.520,1:13:54.880
our island right there. So we've got ocean all 
the way around that black forest. Looks like we

1:13:54.880,1:14:03.040
ran most of that coastline. We've been all the 
way up to here. Um the only other thing is if we

1:14:03.040,1:14:12.720
head up this way. So I think we saw Eekther was on 
our map. He's down here. Wouldn't hurt to do some

1:14:12.720,1:14:20.960
exploring. Maybe there's another black forest over 
here, but I think we were running out of room.

1:14:20.960,1:14:28.960
Let's just go hunt some deer and see if we can get 
enough hides. Before we do that, how many hides

1:14:28.960,1:14:39.760
do we need for our upgrades? So, to upgrade the 
cape is four, the tunic is six more. That's 10.

1:14:40.720,1:14:45.840
The helmet is six more. That's 16.

1:14:45.840,1:14:55.040
The trousers are six more. That's 22. 
22 deerhide. Plus, if we take a look at

1:14:55.040,1:15:04.480
what we need for the crafting station, that 
is five more. We need 27 total deer hide.

1:15:05.360,1:15:15.520
We have We have four. So, we need 23 more.

1:15:15.520,1:15:28.720
Let's see if we can get some honey from the bees.

1:15:28.720,1:15:32.960
There we go. Keep building 
up that supply of honey.

1:15:34.720,1:15:43.520
Let's What do we have in the way of storage? 
Is this full? That's That's full. We picked up

1:15:43.520,1:15:53.200
uh piece of thistle. We'll need that for cooking 
later. I want to see what I can offload. Um

1:15:53.200,1:15:59.600
so that we can continue to collect resources as 
we go along. I think everything's pretty well

1:15:59.600,1:16:10.640
stacked up. Let's uh let's see. We'll 
probably move our treasure into here.

1:16:10.640,1:16:17.760
And we don't have any more room in our food chest. 
So, these are going to go over here. Wouldn't

1:16:17.760,1:16:25.920
mind getting rid of that hoe, but we can carry it 
around. That gives us a little bit of space. Uh,

1:16:25.920,1:16:31.840
running lower on the wood arrows, gaining 
those flint arrows cuz that's what we keep

1:16:31.840,1:16:46.720
finding. Let's go deer hunting and let's 
head let's head off in this direction. Um,

1:16:46.720,1:16:51.440
don't want to get too close to those 
bores. I don't want to get them excited.

1:16:52.800,1:17:03.040
So, the taming time with the bores, we have to 
be around it for a total of 30 minutes. Roughly,

1:17:03.040,1:17:12.400
30 to 60. I think it's 30 though. That time 
doesn't go away just because we leave. So,

1:17:12.400,1:17:17.760
let's say we were around it for five minutes 
and we come back for another five minutes.

1:17:17.760,1:17:25.680
We've taken a total of 10 minutes then off 
and we have 20 minutes left of taming. So

1:17:25.680,1:17:32.000
given that we don't need the bore right now 
and we don't need to start breeding right now,

1:17:32.000,1:17:45.360
we can just let it accumulate as we go. 
All right, guys. You want a piece of me?

1:17:49.600,1:17:55.440
That resin will always come in handy. We 
need more wood. That's why we were chopping

1:17:55.440,1:18:12.400
up those dead stumps and logs. But I got to pay 
attention to the deer. That's what we're here for.

1:18:12.400,1:18:14.720
Like to be able to find deer out in the open.

1:18:20.560,1:18:25.360
so that I can see them. All these scrub trees

1:18:25.360,1:18:32.880
tend to hide them. Makes it a 
lot harder to see your quarry.

1:18:32.880,1:18:41.680
Got 14 wood. I wouldn't mind 
having a little more wood on me.

1:18:41.680,1:18:46.640
Now, as we're covering ground, we've 
covered before, like right now,

1:18:46.640,1:18:50.080
as we head through this map, we've 
been through most of here. We're

1:18:50.080,1:18:59.840
going to find we see a lot less bore, 
a lot less of everything in general.

1:18:59.840,1:19:13.760
As we scare it off, it wanders off.

1:19:13.760,1:19:23.520
So, we're just going to um see what we can find.

1:19:29.200,1:19:39.120
We get up here and get some 
elevation. We can look down.

1:19:39.120,1:19:49.760
Maybe get a little better 
insight into what's around us.

1:19:49.760,1:19:52.640
Boy, I'd like to find some deer now.

1:19:55.600,1:20:04.320
Do we check out this house? No, this is new. 
So, this was in one of the patches. There's

1:20:04.320,1:20:12.240
some skeletons near here cuz they're killing 
the boar. Over that way, it looks like blood

1:20:12.240,1:20:21.760
on the ground. I haven't ever seen this before, 
though I have heard about it. This is an arena.

1:20:22.560,1:20:28.960
There's a spawner in the middle of it.

1:20:28.960,1:20:38.480
And I believe that's a grey dwarf spawner. Nope, 
that's a skeleton spawner. This would have been

1:20:38.480,1:20:48.400
an easy much easier source of skeleton 
bones. All right, guys. What you got?

1:20:53.520,1:20:56.240
much easier source of skeleton bones than having

1:20:56.240,1:21:04.560
to go dungeon crawling. But I 
I enjoyed that dungeon crawl.

1:21:04.560,1:21:14.400
I don't want to destroy that spawner. Let's just 
close the door on these guys. Whoa, he hits hard.

1:21:14.400,1:21:17.040
I think he can get out of there.

1:21:21.840,1:21:23.920
But this structure, this is new. This is not

1:21:23.920,1:21:31.600
one I've ever seen before in the 
game. Came out in recent patch.

1:21:31.600,1:21:42.000
Let's um let's drop a crafting station 
here. Let's do some repairs real quick.

1:21:46.240,1:21:55.360
Um, kind of fun. Experience something new in the 
game. I've been playing for several years. Oh,

1:21:55.360,1:22:04.080
that's a twostar skeleton. I think 
you tell because he's so red,

1:22:04.080,1:22:13.280
but this is I think this is called the arena. I'm 
not sure what they called it. What is he? Yeah,

1:22:13.280,1:22:26.160
he's a two star. Kind of tough. We could probably 
take him, but we don't need to right now.

1:22:26.160,1:22:32.640
This is a great place for us to come 
and level up our skills if we wanted

1:22:32.640,1:22:37.520
to grind. I don't want to grind. Let's leave it.

1:22:38.880,1:22:45.600
So

1:22:45.600,1:22:55.440
they'll eventually break their way out of there.

1:22:55.440,1:23:03.760
Very interesting. Hadn't ran across that before. 
I got to figure out what I want to do with it.

1:23:03.760,1:23:07.120
We're going to need mushrooms to feed those bores.

1:23:07.120,1:23:17.040
They'll eat mushrooms. They'll eat 
berries. Um, they won't eat meat.

1:23:17.040,1:23:27.280
These the boores in Valheim are vegetarians.

1:23:27.280,1:23:28.880
All right, let's take a look. Where are we

1:23:28.880,1:23:35.040
going? The wrong way. We could head 
over here. Pick up those mushrooms.

1:23:37.840,1:23:44.720
And then I want to head back uh in the direction 
that we hadn't been. Wonder if we can find the

1:23:44.720,1:23:54.160
place we stayed in that night. What was that? 
Day six or seven. Okay, that mushroom patch

1:23:54.160,1:24:03.040
was supposed to be close by here, right? Maybe 
we That's maybe that's what we just picked up.

1:24:03.040,1:24:09.760
I don't know. Anyway,

1:24:09.760,1:24:13.360
I hear it.

1:24:13.360,1:24:20.800
Where did he go? There's a boar. We want deer.

1:24:20.800,1:24:26.480
Really hard to find the deer when you want them.

1:24:26.480,1:24:33.360
There's another onear boore. I'm not going to 
mess with it cuz we don't need him now. would

1:24:33.360,1:24:44.240
tame that one star boar. Eventually, 
we will start breeding onestar bores.

1:24:44.240,1:24:51.680
Where's the deer, though?

1:24:51.680,1:25:00.640
Got his attention.

1:25:00.640,1:25:16.160
Did we scare off? There he is. Did I see antlers? 
Is that a star? Deer. Oh, not eating food.

1:25:16.160,1:25:23.440
Where did he go?

1:25:23.440,1:25:31.120
Yes. One star deer. That's going to 
give us more pelts, more deer hide.

1:25:33.120,1:25:39.280
There we go. Where's his buddy?

1:25:39.280,1:25:48.880
Is his buddy around? Yep. And he's a one star.

1:25:48.880,1:25:52.560
That was handy.

1:25:52.560,1:25:58.080
How many deer hide did we get? We get four 
deer hide from each of the onestar deer.

1:25:59.040,1:26:04.160
We needed 23. We've got eight 
new ones. That leaves us what?

1:26:04.160,1:26:15.360
15 to go. Don't ask me to do 
math. I want to play the game.

1:26:15.360,1:26:22.320
We need 23 more. That's really all that matters.

1:26:22.320,1:26:30.000
There a bee in here? No bee. If there is 
chest, we probably already emptied it. Yes,

1:26:30.000,1:26:43.200
we've been here before. There's another 
deer. I don't see antlers, though.

1:26:43.200,1:26:52.160
Let's get a little closer. Out 
of range of that crude bow.

1:26:52.160,1:27:06.560
Don't go away. Oh, duck on it. Yeah, 
his buddy's still around here somewhere.

1:27:06.560,1:27:09.760
All right.

1:27:09.760,1:27:20.240
I know we had a shelter around here that we 
stayed in last time. Is that it over there?

1:27:20.240,1:27:23.840
Oh, I don't want to mess with you right now.

1:27:26.560,1:27:33.360
No, that's We took that apart for bees.

1:27:33.360,1:27:37.760
Lost our rested bonus.

1:27:37.760,1:27:44.880
I'm almost sure there's a house here that 
we stayed in before and we're going to stay

1:27:44.880,1:27:52.960
in again. So, those temporary shelters, we should 
mark those on our map because they come in handy.

1:27:53.920,1:27:59.920
Oh, where's that deer? I heard 
him. He should be visible. We're

1:27:59.920,1:28:08.400
in such open area. That is the house 
we stayed in. So, let's find this deer.

1:28:08.400,1:28:15.280
God, I can hear him.

1:28:21.120,1:28:26.160
I think we're getting further away. 
Look at this nice piles of wood. We

1:28:26.160,1:28:33.200
should grab these. Bring them back. We're 
going to need lots of wood when we start

1:28:33.200,1:28:38.800
emptying uh when we start doing 
ore. And we're going to turn wood

1:28:38.800,1:28:48.320
into coal. I can't see the deer anywhere. 
I'm blind. He's got to be here. Anyway,

1:28:48.320,1:29:10.480
let's grab a pile of this wood. Are we 
in range of our Where is he? So close.

1:29:10.480,1:29:13.120
Down by the water.

1:29:20.160,1:29:27.920
Sounds closer. Is he over there?

1:29:27.920,1:29:35.600
I see some shapes. Yep, there he is. Nice of 
him to highlight right against the water's edge

1:29:35.600,1:29:49.120
for us. I think he's got a friend there, 
too, but I don't Don't want to spook him.

1:29:49.120,1:29:59.360
Don't want it to be night time 
on me either. There we go.

1:29:59.360,1:30:06.160
Duck down. Let's get the other one.

1:30:06.160,1:30:20.960
There he is. He's probably going to see us. Not 
in time. All right, we need to eat some honey.

1:30:20.960,1:30:25.760
Couple more.

1:30:25.760,1:30:34.800
11. We need 20 12 more.

1:30:34.800,1:30:38.720
Maybe tomorrow.

1:30:47.120,1:30:54.880
Is this not the front? Don't 
make me get my torch out. Oh,

1:30:54.880,1:31:03.120
it'd be nice to see in here, 
wouldn't it? We can do that.

1:31:03.120,1:31:12.880
Let's put a torch in here. This is the uh standing 
wood torch. and we'll be able to see more about

1:31:12.880,1:31:26.400
where we are and what's going on. Again, if we had 
that Oh, that torch is too close to the ceiling

1:31:26.400,1:31:29.360
and we used all of our resin.

1:31:30.720,1:31:37.120
Now, I had said previously that 
if you deconstruct something,

1:31:37.120,1:31:47.440
you get the resources back. 
You don't get resin back.

1:31:47.440,1:31:55.600
So, I guess that rule is not 100%.

1:31:55.600,1:32:07.040
We wake with a war cry on our lips. All right.

1:32:07.040,1:32:12.480
Well, let's repair while we're here.

1:32:12.480,1:32:17.120
Always a good idea.

1:32:17.120,1:32:23.520
Wow, we got an endless supply of bones with 
that arena. That's kind of handy and easy way

1:32:23.520,1:32:30.800
to get. I mean that two star two star could be 
dangerous but as long as we're careful shouldn't

1:32:30.800,1:32:46.640
be a problem. And it's misty today so will be hard 
to sneak up on those deer. Ah I hear them though.

1:32:46.640,1:32:50.880
Think they're in the same area.

1:32:53.760,1:33:01.440
No, it sounds like we're getting further away.

1:33:01.440,1:33:07.680
Reach in some stamina.

1:33:07.680,1:33:12.480
I hear something walking through the grass.

1:33:13.920,1:33:19.520
I'm never sure if these sounds are just 
ambient sounds for the fun of it or is

1:33:19.520,1:33:27.360
it really an indication? Often times it's an 
indication, but like when we're in the in the

1:33:27.360,1:33:37.760
skeleton burial chamber of that dungeon, there's 
lots of ambient sounds that don't mean anything.

1:33:44.560,1:33:51.280
The other thing I've never been able to figure out 
is if the sounds are actually directional. Either

1:33:51.280,1:34:07.440
my headphones or my speakers aren't good enough. 
I can never determine a direction from the sound.

1:34:07.440,1:34:11.760
stop and let their stamina regenerate. We don't

1:34:11.760,1:34:19.440
want to get there and then not have 
enough stamina to make it take a shot.

1:34:19.440,1:34:25.120
I think we're getting closer. It's getting louder.

1:34:25.120,1:34:33.440
Wish I could see a silhouette 
of a deer. There's one

1:34:33.440,1:34:35.680
too far away.

1:34:38.320,1:34:42.160
I don't think he can see us. I don't think 
we need to sneak yet. Let's make a little

1:34:42.160,1:34:54.880
faster progress here. This is another 
uh another burial area. All right,

1:34:54.880,1:35:05.360
I misplaced where I put that deer. 
Is he out here on the island?

1:35:05.360,1:35:12.880
Talk to me.

1:35:12.880,1:35:19.040
Getting our sneak skills up. 
Once we get the troll armor,

1:35:19.040,1:35:27.440
it gives us a 15 if we have all the pieces 
on. Gives us a plus 15 to sneak. And frankly,

1:35:27.440,1:35:36.880
it's 15 sneak whether we're sneaking 
or not. So, it's kind of nice. Um,

1:35:36.880,1:35:47.600
a lot of players will tell you to wear 
that troll armor well into the later biome.

1:35:51.040,1:35:56.880
Some people will wear it in the 
black forest and into the biome

1:35:56.880,1:36:09.200
after the black forest. Where is 
that guy? We've got to be close.

1:36:09.200,1:36:14.720
He's got to be right here. Oh, we 
needed one more flint, didn't we?

1:36:17.280,1:36:26.480
Let's grab one while we're 
here. Maybe a few extra.

1:36:26.480,1:36:37.120
Where's it? Where did that little guy go?

1:36:44.240,1:36:58.960
Don't want to run into a neck. Have to fight him 
and scare the deer off. But the deer's eluding me.

1:36:58.960,1:37:04.480
I should have marked the spot where 
he was a lot better than I did.

1:37:10.640,1:37:17.920
I think he's getting further away.

1:37:17.920,1:37:26.960
Oh, the mist is cleared. That's nice.

1:37:36.640,1:37:55.120
I don't know how we missed him, 
but I swear we passed him up.

1:38:10.800,1:38:20.560
I'm sure that sound he's closer. 
We've got to be in the area.

1:38:20.560,1:38:22.960
Bore.

1:38:41.200,1:38:48.800
I think he's really close. And there he is.

1:38:48.800,1:38:59.440
I think he'll see us. Oh, didn't 
have my bow out. That was so stupid.

1:38:59.440,1:39:05.120
There's still another one.

1:39:05.120,1:39:12.960
It's behind that rock and that tree.

1:39:12.960,1:39:19.120
Tree is going to block my shot. Here 
we go. Not looking our direction.

1:39:22.720,1:39:34.160
Where's his buddy?

1:39:34.160,1:39:40.640
You know he's here. And as 
soon as we give up on him,

1:39:40.640,1:39:45.600
he'll appear. There he is.

1:39:45.600,1:39:47.680
We get that shot.

1:39:51.600,1:39:58.320
Got him. I think that's everything in the area.

1:39:58.320,1:40:10.160
And we got another trophy. That's always good. 
That trophy. We get enough of those trophies after

1:40:10.160,1:40:16.320
I think we have to beat the uh 
the boss of the biome, Ether.

1:40:18.080,1:40:27.360
13 10 to go.

1:40:27.360,1:40:35.920
After we take on Ether, those trophies, we 
can use them to make a that weapon that I

1:40:35.920,1:40:42.880
was talking about in the dungeon 
that will attack through walls.

1:40:46.160,1:40:53.680
So, even though we Oh, that's a 
deer. That's not a boar. All right.

1:40:53.680,1:41:02.880
It's a little long shot. Aim 
a little higher. Too low.

1:41:02.880,1:41:10.720
Got him. And we've got this gray.

1:41:10.720,1:41:21.360
Don't want to get too close. I'll scare 
his buddy off. Still want that second one.

1:41:21.360,1:41:30.400
Let's see if we can find his buddy. There 
he is. Switch to the bow this time. He's

1:41:30.400,1:41:40.480
looking right at us. That could be scary 
for him. There we go. Two more. Eight to go.

1:41:46.400,1:41:53.280
Well, even though we're taming Bors, never 
hurts to go ahead and take him out. See how

1:41:53.280,1:41:57.520
he's a little blue? You can tell he's a one 
star because of his color. I bet that guy's

1:41:57.520,1:42:06.000
a two star cuz he's a different color. So, 
neck, unlike some of the other creatures,

1:42:06.000,1:42:16.480
neck get bigger and they change 
color. uh when they're starred.

1:42:16.480,1:42:23.200
I've never noticed that the bores look that 
much different. If you find a starred bore

1:42:23.200,1:42:36.480
versus a non-starred boar. Oh, blew that. 
But his buddy's still here somewhere.

1:42:36.480,1:42:39.440
God, he should be close. 
There's not much room for him.

1:42:45.440,1:42:50.000
Is he not part of a pair?

1:42:50.000,1:42:58.480
Wish I had my fishing pole. This 
looks like a nice fishing spot.

1:42:58.480,1:43:01.840
So unusual to find a fishing pole before you get

1:43:01.840,1:43:07.840
to the vendor and buy it, but 
it sure is nice when you do.

1:43:12.880,1:43:23.280
That deer was the respawn of the ones 
we took out just before nightfall.

1:43:23.280,1:43:34.960
Don't know where he went. We will see him 
come back. Let's go get our rested bonus.

1:43:34.960,1:43:39.840
So you can see this

1:43:39.840,1:43:45.920
low comfort level here only giving us a comfort 
level of four. So we only get an 11 minute rested

1:43:45.920,1:43:54.560
bonus. I think you can get up to a comfort level 
of 17 or more. And you do that by adding items

1:43:54.560,1:43:59.200
uh around you to improve your comfort. 
Bed is an item that jumps the comfort

1:43:59.200,1:44:04.320
level up. If we were in the house without 
a bed, it'd be a comfort level of three.

1:44:06.000,1:44:23.760
Um, adding chair and tables 
will increase our comfort level.

1:44:23.760,1:44:31.280
There he is. Let's hide. See 
if uh he'll let us get close.

1:44:33.040,1:44:40.000
Thought I saw movement to 
the left. So I don't want

1:44:40.000,1:44:49.040
to start a fight with like one of those neck.

1:44:49.040,1:44:58.640
We need to eat food. See our stamina bar dropping.

1:44:58.640,1:45:06.880
Wonder if I get that neck, too. Nope.

1:45:06.880,1:45:16.000
Yep. All right, let's take care of that food.

1:45:16.000,1:45:22.160
And that was the guy that ran off. So, I don't 
think there's more around. These guys are Oh,

1:45:22.160,1:45:28.800
he was a He's going to give 
us two. All right, guys.

1:45:30.400,1:45:38.560
So later in the game, we're going to start 
using those necktail again. Uh they become

1:45:38.560,1:45:48.160
valuable once more in one of the um more 
advanced recipes. Pretty sure we'd been

1:45:48.160,1:45:58.080
there before. Most of these places we've been to 
before now. Uh but we did leave a beehive behind.

1:45:58.080,1:46:11.600
There it is. I don't know if I can 
get an arrow on that. Let's see.

1:46:11.600,1:46:23.440
Bingo. Nope.

1:46:23.440,1:46:26.560
Got to get a little higher ground.

1:46:32.400,1:46:44.880
That take it out? It did. And we've 
got inventory space. So, there we go.

1:46:44.880,1:46:52.480
Nothing else in there, but we got the uh 
queen bee added to our collection of honey.

1:46:54.000,1:46:59.200
All right, let's see if we can get the last 
of those deer. What do we need? We're up

1:46:59.200,1:47:09.200
to 17. We only need five more. I hear him. 
It's always fun trying to find him, though.

1:47:09.200,1:47:20.000
Oh, I thought that Oh, duck, duck, 
duck. Didn't get my bow out again.

1:47:24.480,1:47:28.400
Sorry about that. I had to 
pause to cough. Muted the

1:47:28.400,1:47:35.680
mic because I didn't want to cough in your ear.

1:47:35.680,1:47:44.480
194 to go. Wait, he should 
have a buddy around here.

1:47:50.800,1:47:58.880
Wonder where he is.

1:47:58.880,1:48:11.120
I'm not seeing him.

1:48:11.120,1:48:22.240
I hear a boar. that little snarl 
in the grass and I hear footsteps

1:48:22.240,1:48:31.360
besides my own.

1:48:31.360,1:48:38.000
I'm not hearing any barking.

1:48:38.000,1:48:45.440
Guess guess he was a solo, but there is 
one off in the distance. Let's grab these

1:48:45.440,1:48:52.400
mushrooms while we're here. We need more bore 
food. Uh we can feed them raspberries. There's

1:48:52.400,1:48:58.240
definitely a larger supply of raspberries than 
there is mushrooms. More more easily found,

1:48:58.240,1:49:06.080
not a larger supply. They're they're more I think 
the raspberries are definitely more plentiful.

1:49:11.040,1:49:21.840
There is a deer in the distance. 
I can't tell what direction.

1:49:21.840,1:49:31.040
That might be a stick.

1:49:31.040,1:49:34.560
Yeah, that brown. Oh, there he is. Look at that.

1:49:35.440,1:49:47.200
This is a So, with this shot being downhill, 
we're not going to aim as high over him

1:49:47.200,1:49:55.520
cuz the arrow is going to drop with the hill.

1:49:55.520,1:50:04.400
Now, then is there another one hiding 
over here across the creek? Was that

1:50:04.400,1:50:12.960
the buddy to the one that we couldn't find before?

1:50:12.960,1:50:25.440
Now, I said I wanted to carry five stone 
around with me and I haven't been doing it.

1:50:25.440,1:50:33.200
I hear him out there. Would love to find him. 
Oh, we didn't mark that house on the map.

1:50:33.200,1:50:37.120
going to have to search for it. 
I think it's going to be pretty

1:50:37.120,1:50:53.040
easy to find. But if I let it get 
dark on me, makes it a lot harder.

1:50:53.040,1:50:57.360
I think that was our fifth stone.

1:50:57.360,1:51:00.000
Yep.

1:51:02.320,1:51:07.120
So, takes five stones to make a 
fire and just kind of like to keep

1:51:07.120,1:51:15.440
one around when I can just in case. 
Yeah, gorgeous sunset. And you get in

1:51:15.440,1:51:23.760
the mountains. Some of these biomes, 
they have the most gorgeous sunsets.

1:51:23.760,1:51:29.120
Oh, those are neck. You see those little water 
droplets? They let you know that somebody just

1:51:29.120,1:51:39.600
walked through the water, but those are all 
neck. It's real easy to spot a deer that way

1:51:39.600,1:51:49.280
when you see the water 
droplets coming off of them.

1:51:49.280,1:51:55.760
Let's grab this bore while we're 
here. Oh, there's a grey dwarf.

1:51:57.280,1:52:08.720
Let's do our first grey dwarf fight 
here. Looks a lot like the gremlin.

1:52:08.720,1:52:16.080
About twice the hit points. And 
he drops those gray dwarf eyes.

1:52:16.080,1:52:20.000
We'll use those in different crafting recipes.

1:52:21.360,1:52:29.280
Uh, and one of the most important ones 
is the certling cores that we pulled up,

1:52:29.280,1:52:37.520
picked up when we were in that dungeon. 
Certling cores plus some finewood

1:52:37.520,1:52:43.680
and some grey dwarf eyes and we 
make oursel a portal. Cuts down

1:52:43.680,1:52:49.280
on all this running around because we can 
just portal to the area we want to be in.

1:52:50.560,1:52:57.440
given that we've been there 
before and set up a portal.

1:52:57.440,1:53:03.920
So, let's say we wanted to call 
this our base away from home. We

1:53:03.920,1:53:11.280
could put a portal here and just 
portal over anytime we wanted.

1:53:11.280,1:53:24.480
All right, three more. Three more 
deer hide. We'll upgrade our armor.

1:53:24.480,1:53:29.040
We've been at this for a while now. 
Um it's going to head back in the

1:53:29.040,1:53:35.600
direction of home. Uh this will 
be the last day on this recording

1:53:35.600,1:53:45.840
and going to give some thought to 
whether I want to take on ether.

1:53:45.840,1:53:52.960
take on ether with our upgraded hide 
armor. All right, there were deer that

1:53:52.960,1:54:02.160
spawned over here. We killed them a 
day or two ago. Have they respawned?

1:54:02.160,1:54:09.520
Look at that.

1:54:09.520,1:54:14.000
That's close enough. Let's get our stamina back.

1:54:16.800,1:54:30.240
Don't want to scare him off, but I would 
like to wrap up this hunt for deer hide.

1:54:30.240,1:54:37.280
All right. Is his buddy back there? I 
think spawnwise the last one we killed,

1:54:37.280,1:54:40.160
it might be too soon for a respawn.

1:54:41.120,1:54:52.960
I'm not hearing any anything that sounds like 
there's a deer nearby. So, we got one from him.

1:54:52.960,1:54:58.240
Should have marked I don't know that 
that matters. I don't think they like

1:54:58.240,1:55:02.000
we I was going to say we should have 
marked where that starred deer was,

1:55:02.000,1:55:08.400
but I don't think they're going to come 
back as starred. Even if we did mark it,

1:55:08.400,1:55:15.520
we need to go up towards the corner to 
the right. Going to take us through this

1:55:15.520,1:55:33.200
clearing. Doubt that we'll see any deer here. 
I heard one though. Is that him right there?

1:55:33.200,1:55:34.160
Right there.

1:55:43.040,1:55:54.800
Got that bow out. I think he's facing 
us. So, he may bolt on us. Yep.

1:55:54.800,1:56:00.160
I wonder if he has a buddy nearby.

1:56:06.960,1:56:17.120
I hear one in the distance.

1:56:17.120,1:56:27.360
You see that water dripping? That's the deer 
that just ran off and ran through the water.

1:56:27.360,1:56:32.400
Can we get a shot from here? Maybe

1:56:32.400,1:56:38.240
it's a long shot for this crude bow.

1:56:38.240,1:56:41.840
Got him.

1:56:41.840,1:56:53.840
Also got that uh that neck excited.

1:56:53.840,1:56:57.120
There's another one's nearby.

1:57:13.440,1:57:15.280
that one star neck. You could tell he had

1:57:15.280,1:57:21.520
a few more hit points cuz they 
usually go down with one hit.

1:57:25.040,1:57:29.680
Oh, that's a two star.

1:57:29.680,1:57:33.600
Look at those antlers.

1:57:33.600,1:57:43.680
One star. That might be enough 
hide right there to end our hunt.

1:57:43.680,1:57:50.960
Now, I don't think he's paired with the one 
that we just killed. His buddy may be around.

1:57:54.800,1:58:10.000
27. That's what we needed total. So, let's head 
back for the house. Uh, let's make it just a

1:58:10.000,1:58:20.240
We'll just run all the way. 
Let our stam drain our stamina.

1:58:20.240,1:58:28.880
regen it. Drain it. We got three 
minutes left on our rested buff.

1:58:28.880,1:58:33.920
That should put us about halfway 
through the day then 10 minutes.

1:58:33.920,1:58:40.240
I don't want to mess with you right 
now. H we need to go more this way.

1:58:40.240,1:58:45.200
It's easier running through 
these clearings anyway. I got

1:58:45.200,1:58:58.000
him all excited running across there like that.

1:58:58.000,1:59:09.120
All right, regen that stamina.

1:59:09.120,1:59:12.160
Sound structure caught my eye.

1:59:13.680,1:59:22.800
Ah, we got a double. You heard that little 
ding? That means that our skill at gathering,

1:59:22.800,1:59:29.920
I suppose it's a gathering skill, um, 
doubled up how many items we got when

1:59:29.920,1:59:38.800
we picked that mushroom, which 
is nice. Can always use the extra

1:59:45.600,1:59:53.200
probably want to give those bores 
some more food when we get back there.

1:59:53.200,2:00:00.240
And since we're feeding the bores, we 
probably want to gather up our raspberries.

2:00:00.240,2:00:04.240
Uh, but we don't have room. I'm going 
to ditch the rock that we thought,

2:00:04.240,2:00:10.720
oh, let's get rid of the neck trophy. 
Never found a use for neck trophies.

2:00:10.720,2:00:26.080
Maybe there'll be one someday. Maybe 
there's one now and I just don't know it.

2:00:26.080,2:00:34.320
That's the um that's the 
big ravine next to our home.

2:00:34.320,2:00:36.480
So, we're getting close. Don't think we're going

2:00:36.480,2:00:51.520
to get there in time for our rested 
bonus, but we're going to be close.

2:00:51.520,2:01:00.240
Seen that plenty of time. Oh, 
look at that. Hadn't seen us yet.

2:01:00.240,2:01:04.640
Yes, we have all we need for 
now, but we'll need more later.

2:01:11.600,2:01:19.120
You probably haven't gathered enough 
resources, no matter what they are,

2:01:19.120,2:01:23.040
especially not at this point in the game. Ah,

2:01:23.040,2:01:33.600
there we go. Home sweet home. It's going to 
get the boores excited, but let's feed them.

2:01:35.600,2:01:45.520
Give them half of these raspberries and then 
we'll get out of their way and let them calm down.

2:01:45.520,2:01:51.280
While we're here, let's gather up some honey.

2:01:51.280,2:02:06.400
Three.

2:02:06.400,2:02:12.560
Let's drop a new chest in here.

2:02:12.560,2:02:17.760
We'll just kind of use this for 
the storage room rather than

2:02:17.760,2:02:20.480
clutter up our house with a lot of extra storage.

2:02:22.800,2:02:32.240
Uh, let's move our trophies out here

2:02:32.240,2:02:41.520
cuz we don't access trophies that often.

2:02:41.520,2:02:58.000
Just a quick swap. If we drop it on,

2:02:58.000,2:03:08.000
that's good. Oh, we could put Let's see. There 
we go. The flint goes down below. It's nice to

2:03:08.000,2:03:13.600
keep these organized. Uh, it's real easy for 
it to get out of hand. Before you know it,

2:03:13.600,2:03:36.640
you have chests everywhere if 
you're not organizing your stuff.

2:03:36.640,2:03:41.280
What do we have? We can get rid of

2:03:41.280,2:03:48.160
maybe time for another food table. Food 
table. Another food chest. Getting so

2:03:48.160,2:03:58.080
much deer meat and bore meat. And we'll use it.

2:03:58.080,2:04:01.600
We'll use it. All right.

2:04:03.200,2:04:13.680
Can we do any of these upgrades without 
a three? We need to upgrade. First thing,

2:04:13.680,2:04:19.040
we need to upgrade the crafting 
table with this tanning rack. So,

2:04:19.040,2:04:28.400
we need the 15 flint and we need five 
deer hide and we need 20 leather scraps.

2:04:30.480,2:04:38.800
Nothing there. There's our flint. There's our 
deer hide. There's more than enough leather

2:04:38.800,2:04:52.960
scraps. We got the wood. We're going to put 
this outside. It has to be fairly close to the

2:04:52.960,2:04:58.160
workstation. So, we'll put it right here 
on the other side of the workstation.

2:04:58.160,2:05:09.440
That'll take us to workstation level three. 
And we unlock some new recipes, specifically

2:05:09.440,2:05:18.640
this bone shield. That bone tower shield that 
gives us a block armor of 32 compared to our

2:05:18.640,2:05:27.520
shield which has a block armor of 12. That's an 
increase of 20. That bone shield is fabulous for

2:05:27.520,2:05:38.560
blocking. Has no parry bonus whatsoever. And it 
has a 10% movement speed movement speed penalty.

2:05:38.560,2:05:43.760
So we make that we carry it around with us. 
If we have it out, we're going to move 10%

2:05:43.760,2:05:49.520
slower. Doesn't sound like much, but boy, you 
start to feel it after a while. especially if

2:05:49.520,2:05:55.920
you're trying to run away from something, run 
around something while you're fighting it. Um,

2:05:55.920,2:06:06.560
it's a it's a game day style choice. Uh, some 
people like to kind of be a heavy tank and, uh,

2:06:06.560,2:06:12.960
other people prefer the quick movement. A lot of 
the people that I listen to on YouTube, they want

2:06:12.960,2:06:26.400
the movement. All right, give me a second. Got 
a cough again. this cold. Can't help it. Sorry.

2:06:26.400,2:06:32.640
All right, I'm back and I apologize. Oh, 
the crude bow. We didn't I don't think we

2:06:32.640,2:06:37.280
counted the two extra, but we picked 
up two more than we needed to. Let's

2:06:37.280,2:06:46.000
upgrade that crude bow. What do we need 
for the deerhide cape? We need five bone.

2:06:47.200,2:07:01.680
Where's our bone? Got 27. I hope that's enough 
bone to do all of the upgrades. Deer hide cape.

2:07:01.680,2:07:09.440
Doesn't raise the armor level. Not sure that that 
was worth the effort. Oh, we made one. We didn't

2:07:09.440,2:07:17.360
upgrade. That's a common mistake I make. Forget 
to switch the tab. I think I'm upgrading. Okay,

2:07:17.360,2:07:27.920
this will give us an armor of two. And 
that may just short us on the number of

2:07:27.920,2:07:35.680
that. That That's a stupid mistake. We want 
to upgrade. So, we don't want to upgrade that

2:07:35.680,2:07:43.440
one. We're just going to go stick it in the 
chest. Let's upgrade our tunic. Let's upgrade

2:07:43.440,2:07:53.280
our trousers. All of these are going from two 
to four. Let's upgrade that leather helmet.

2:07:53.280,2:08:03.760
All right, so we made the workstation upgrade. We 
made the armors upgrade. We're at two. We can't

2:08:03.760,2:08:12.640
go to four until we get a level. We can't go to 
upgrade level three. until we get workstation

2:08:12.640,2:08:19.280
level four. I don't remember for sure, but I 
don't think that we can upgrade the workstation

2:08:19.280,2:08:29.440
to four until after we've defeated Ether. I 
believe the next upgrade is going to require

2:08:29.440,2:08:37.040
uh us to have some ore that we've brought out of 
the Black Forest. We need the pickaxe to do that.

2:08:37.040,2:08:42.800
We can't make our pickaxe until we kill ether. And 
that's one of the things that we're going to see

2:08:42.800,2:08:51.920
throughout the game is that the boss will unlock 
an item that allows us to take full advantage of

2:08:51.920,2:09:02.320
the next biome. In this case, it's the pickaxe. We 
don't get the pickaxe pickaxe recipe until we kill

2:09:02.320,2:09:09.520
the boss and get his drops. Along with getting his 
drops, we're going to unlock a few other things.

2:09:09.520,2:09:18.720
Not going to spoil that. Uh we'll we'll cover that 
after we fight Ether for now. We're at level two

2:09:18.720,2:09:27.200
unless we went to troll armor and uh kind of jump 
the gun here. That's as good as it's going to get.

2:09:27.200,2:09:39.280
If we crude bow, we can't do it. We can upgrade 
our uh our axe for the ether fight. wouldn't be

2:09:39.280,2:09:45.840
a bad idea. Wouldn't be a bad idea to have a 
backup crude bow. I've seen people go into the

2:09:45.840,2:09:55.440
ether fight. You primarily using arrows for that. 
Um, and you shoot as so many arrows that your bow

2:09:55.440,2:10:04.800
breaks and you might want to have a backup. 
Um, we're going to craft new arrows for that.

2:10:05.440,2:10:12.400
Um, we want these fire arrows for the eek 
fight. And the the advantage to the fire

2:10:12.400,2:10:20.000
arrows do a little bit less damage, but 
they they do the fire dot. So, we want to

2:10:20.000,2:10:28.560
keep Ether on fire for the whole fight. So, the 
fire is taking making him take damage along with

2:10:28.560,2:10:40.320
uh every time we shoot him. We're going to spend 
a lot of time dodging him and his attacks, and

2:10:40.320,2:10:50.080
we want to continue giving him damage even when 
we're dodging. We do that with the fire dot. Well,

2:10:50.080,2:11:01.200
this has been a great trip. We have upgraded 
our armor. Let's go get rid of that extra cape.

2:11:01.760,2:11:10.080
It's not terrible that we built it, made 
it, but sure wish I hadn't done that. I

2:11:10.080,2:11:18.480
like these in order. I don't think it matters. 
Just personal. We're going to move that inside.

2:11:18.480,2:11:25.040
Um, and we'll start using 
this for all the trophies.

2:11:25.040,2:11:32.400
We've uh we've come a long way. It's been a been 
a good trip through the meadows. We're on day 10,

2:11:32.400,2:11:39.840
11, 12, somewhere in there. We've got bores that 
are breeding pretty soon. We're going to start

2:11:39.840,2:11:46.800
be able to have those bores be friendly 
and and um we'll be able to feed them and

2:11:46.800,2:11:54.960
breed them and have that unlimited sl of bore 
meat, leather scraps. Built a nice home base.

2:11:54.960,2:12:02.880
got a nice beehive um honey factory going. 
Winnie the Pooh would be real happy with

2:12:02.880,2:12:15.360
it. So am I. Um I'd say overall given the amount 
of time we did uh we did pretty well. Had a fun

2:12:15.360,2:12:21.840
run into that dungeon. Let's wrap it up here 
for this recording. It's been a lot longer.

2:12:21.840,2:12:29.760
let me know. Um, I like making more progress. Uh, 
let me know what you think. Put something in the

2:12:29.760,2:12:36.640
comments. Love to hear from you. Um, I'm Grandpa 
Bud. We're playing Valheim. Thanks for joining.
