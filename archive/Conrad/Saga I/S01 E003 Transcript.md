## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
The Meadows are no longer a prison; they are a workshop. From Day 3 to Day 5, Conrad begins to impose his will on the 10th World. Between the construction of a permanent hall and the first chilling sight of a Troll on the horizon, the path to Valhalla is being built one stone at a time.
In this chronicle, we master the physics of the North, claim the sweetness of the bees, and find the dark edge where the Meadows meet the Black Forest. An old man knows that a strong roof is just as important as a sharp axe. The Allfather is watching the foundation we lay.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

[0:00:02.320,0:00:09.600
Howdy everybody. I'm Grandpa Bud and we're 
playing Valheim. Going to get started on day

0:00:09.600,0:00:18.800
three in Valheim. Um going to try to outsign 
some quick goals for the day. Um and our time

0:00:18.800,0:00:28.640
here in the meadows. So, one of the first things 
that we want to do is get a bow so that we can

0:00:28.640,0:00:36.160
uh tackle these deer. Once we have a bow and 
start taking down some of the deer, we can look at

0:00:36.160,0:00:43.680
making some deerhide armor. Uh we're going to want 
that as some protection before we take on Ether,

0:00:43.680,0:00:51.360
the boss of the meadows. Um, another thing that 
we want to do is discover the Black Forest. Uh,

0:00:51.360,0:00:57.520
probably build our home base on the Black Forest. 
And we want to get the home base built before we

0:00:57.520,0:01:05.280
take on Ether. Uh, and then the final thing is 
to take on Ether itself. That's going to take

0:01:05.280,0:01:11.440
a few more days before we're ready for that. But 
in the meantime, let's see if we can't get a bow

0:01:11.440,0:01:21.040
and start taking down some of these deer. So, we 
make a bow at the workbench under crude bow. So,

0:01:21.040,0:01:29.360
we only need 10 wood. We've got the eight uh 
leather scraps that we need to make that bow.

0:01:29.360,0:01:39.600
And we're going to need wood to uh make arrows. 
We've got a handful of these flint arrows,

0:01:39.600,0:01:44.480
and they'll be better than the ones that 
we make. We'll use them to start with,

0:01:44.480,0:01:52.960
but eventually we're going to want to switch over. 
Let's go check out this building over here. Uh,

0:01:52.960,0:02:01.840
see what's here. This wouldn't make a bad base if 
we were close to the black forest. Not much in it,

0:02:01.840,0:02:08.800
but most of the walls are in place. We'd only 
have to replace that one roof tile and add a door.

0:02:08.800,0:02:17.120
But instead of doing that, let's put up a 
workbench right here. Um, gonna go to the

0:02:17.120,0:02:24.560
hammer and rightclick. Go to the crafting menu. 
We're short a couple of pieces of wood. So,

0:02:24.560,0:02:31.200
we'll do that. And since we see these mushrooms 
right here, let's grab that first. And then

0:02:31.200,0:02:45.680
we'll take down some of these scrub trees 
so that we have enough wood for a workbench.

0:02:45.680,0:02:52.960
We've been running through the forest pretty 
uh quickly. Not really looking for the deer

0:02:52.960,0:03:03.200
too much. Just tapping them up as we do. Once we 
have a bow, we'll slow that down a little bit and

0:03:03.200,0:03:13.040
uh actually start hunting these deer. Okay, 
let's go to our hammer workbench. Find a nice

0:03:13.040,0:03:23.840
uh place for that to live. And then we're going to 
tear down this house and use the wood for our bow.

0:03:26.400,0:03:33.920
Um, so just for your knowledge, I'm 
switching between tools like the uh flint

0:03:33.920,0:03:40.240
axe and the hammer by just uh pressing 
the number of the hot bar button. Now,

0:03:40.240,0:03:47.760
if I take out the underlying 
structure of this, all the walls,

0:03:47.760,0:03:53.200
anything touching the ground, the rest 
of it will just fall apart on its own.

0:03:55.360,0:04:08.000
Notice how these are different colors that 
indicates uh some of the physics in the game. Oh.

0:04:08.000,0:04:16.560
Uh blue means it's touching the ground and 
is supported by the ground. Green means it is

0:04:16.560,0:04:22.320
uh partially supported and then it'll 
turn orange to red. And once it's red,

0:04:22.320,0:04:29.040
you can't attach anything else to it. It's 
going to fall down. So, we'll see. Like,

0:04:29.040,0:04:34.240
this is red. It's going to eventually fall. 
Now, there's nothing touching the ground.

0:04:34.240,0:04:49.520
The rest of this should just fall and save us the 
trouble of having to tear it all down ourselves.

0:04:49.520,0:05:00.480
Now we should have plenty of wood for our bow.

0:05:00.480,0:05:08.000
Let's grab this table and take uh the wood that it 
used to make it. We're going to head back to our

0:05:08.000,0:05:16.160
um shelter over here. This is the minimum 
shelter that I can build. And I found this

0:05:16.160,0:05:24.880
by another YouTuber online. Um, if I remember, 
I will try to link that in the description so

0:05:24.880,0:05:32.080
that you can see the uh it's just a real 
great tutorial on how to make that. Okay,

0:05:32.080,0:05:39.680
here's our crude bow. Going to craft that. 
And then we've got 31 arrows. Let's go ahead

0:05:39.680,0:05:48.400
and We've got enough wood to make a few arrows. 
Uh, let's get us a 100 wood arrows. wood arrows

0:05:48.400,0:05:59.600
aren't quite as good as those flint arrows, 
but we're going to go through a lot of these.

0:05:59.600,0:06:06.640
I'm going to start with the wood arrows. I'll 
highlight that and then we'll follow up with

0:06:06.640,0:06:18.480
the flint arrows when we've used those up. And we 
can hear some deer in the background, but I don't

0:06:18.480,0:06:29.760
see any. So, we'll we'll continue our exploring. 
See if we can find the edge of the black forest.

0:06:29.760,0:06:36.960
If we happen to notice some deer, we'll stop 
and take those out. Just checking out this rock

0:06:36.960,0:06:45.120
formation. Find one of those burial crypts. Uh 
we can see the other side of the ocean there. Um

0:06:45.120,0:06:56.080
island's getting pretty thin at this point. Uh but 
we can see it still goes quite a ways lengthwise.

0:06:56.080,0:07:01.120
Uh eventually we want to come back and the 
bees that we saw in the first couple of days,

0:07:01.120,0:07:11.120
we'll want to come back and grab those. Um

0:07:11.120,0:07:22.800
because as we said previously that honey 
makes for some really good stamina food.

0:07:22.800,0:07:28.480
You'll notice in these little uh deer stands 
or whatever these little structures are,

0:07:28.480,0:07:33.520
there'll often be a chest up here and we 
can find a little bit of treasure there.

0:07:34.080,0:07:40.560
So, always check out those uh abandoned 
structures. Here's one of those like

0:07:40.560,0:07:46.000
burial grips or I'm not sure what these rock 
formations are. That's what I call it. But

0:07:46.000,0:07:54.000
we'll want those. We'll want those bones 
when we go to make our deer hide armor.

0:07:54.000,0:08:00.320
So, just running around seeing what we 
can see. Anytime you see one of these

0:08:00.320,0:08:08.240
uh stones, it'll give you a 
little bit of history of the

0:08:08.240,0:08:17.520
Viking lore and that kind of drives the game.

0:08:17.520,0:08:24.400
Day in the sun is a day well-lived. Got to agree 
with that. Looking forward to getting out in the

0:08:24.400,0:08:32.640
sun and going for a walk a little bit later. So 
tired of this cold. Okay, here's another one of

0:08:32.640,0:08:52.320
those villages. Always want to approach 
with caution just in case it's occupied.

0:08:52.320,0:08:54.560
Nothing here.

0:08:57.600,0:09:02.560
Don't hear any bees.

0:09:02.560,0:09:12.480
[Music] Getting a collection of torches.

0:09:12.480,0:09:21.520
Ah, we got a beehive in the back. Um, we're 
running out of inventory rooms. That's going to

0:09:21.520,0:09:28.880
be a challenge is managing our inventory, what 
we want to continue to carry around with us,

0:09:28.880,0:09:34.560
uh, versus what we have to let go of.

0:09:34.560,0:09:44.800
These abandoned villages often will 
be a good source of Oh, there's

0:09:44.800,0:09:50.400
good good source of bore meat. 
Got our first boar trophy there.

0:09:51.520,0:10:00.000
Uh, unfortunately I snuck up did not sneak 
up on that deer and he ran off. If you wait

0:10:00.000,0:10:09.600
around in the area, they'll eventually come 
back. Um, you can go into a crouch and hide

0:10:09.600,0:10:16.080
from them and ambush them when they return if 
you've got the patience for it. I don't find

0:10:16.080,0:10:24.480
it worth the time. Just chasing down the last 
of these bores. I saw and I want to go back

0:10:24.480,0:10:30.560
to that village. Looks like the shadows are 
getting kind of long. Might be nearing the

0:10:30.560,0:10:36.160
end end of the day. We'll uh take one 
of these abandoned buildings here and

0:10:36.160,0:10:46.000
make a quick temporary uh housing. Oh, we've 
let all of our food run out. Very dangerous.

0:10:46.000,0:10:53.760
Let's go ahead and eat what we can. Keep 
collecting all these raspberries. We're

0:10:53.760,0:11:05.360
going to need them for a while. They are used 
in all kinds of recipes going forward. [Music]

0:11:05.360,0:11:09.040
All right, just the way we 
tore down that last house,

0:11:09.040,0:11:15.120
let's tear this one down and let's get this 
bee. And maybe we'll even get some honey.

0:11:16.960,0:11:22.080
But it's going to run us short on inventory 
space. So, we'll have some decisions to make

0:11:22.080,0:11:28.640
on what we keep. Got to be careful if 
we don't get too close to those bees get

0:11:28.640,0:11:39.360
poisoned. We probably got enough health that it 
wouldn't kill us, but we don't need the damage.

0:11:42.160,0:11:48.560
take out the piece that's holding it and it's 
going to fall to the ground. And now it's harmless

0:11:48.560,0:11:56.880
and we can go in and pick up and see we get the 
queen bee and the recipe for a beehive. Now we've

0:11:56.880,0:12:06.080
got to decide what we want to get rid of. Um, got 
to keep this wood. Want to keep our treasure. Uh,

0:12:06.080,0:12:14.800
oh, this should be stacked up. And now we've got 
that honey. We'll put that honey up here. And it

0:12:14.800,0:12:26.720
can replace our um current stamina food, which 
is raspberries. And looks like we are out of No,

0:12:26.720,0:12:36.800
we got mushrooms. Let's put mushrooms up 
here. Now we've got a an even mix between

0:12:36.800,0:12:43.680
between that and it's getting on to dark. 
So we need to convert one of these houses

0:12:43.680,0:12:51.440
real quick. Uh we got one rock. We're 
going to need rocks in order to make

0:12:51.440,0:12:57.120
a fire. Uh that's the advantage of 
a home base. we don't have to keep

0:12:57.120,0:13:11.280
searching for materials to set up a shelter 
temporarily. Uh just want to get closer to

0:13:11.280,0:13:22.720
the black forest before we create that home base. 
Now we're left searching for rocks to make a fire.

0:13:22.720,0:13:24.960
There we go. That's two.

0:13:27.600,0:13:33.280
Now, these rocks we can't pick up. They're 
too big. We'd have to wait till we get

0:13:33.280,0:13:38.560
a tool that allow us to break them up 
into smaller rocks. Here we go. Three,

0:13:38.560,0:13:51.280
four, five, and one extra. So, 
let's come up here. This house,

0:13:51.280,0:13:57.840
this house should be good. Now, he won't 
bother us much, but this torch will make

0:13:57.840,0:14:07.440
a great weapon. Puts him on fire and 
applies a fire dot or damage over time,

0:14:07.440,0:14:12.080
which is kind of nice. Oh, this is 
the one we tore down. Let's take a

0:14:12.080,0:14:24.800
look. We can do this one. Going to replace 
these roof pieces. We've got uh to drop a

0:14:24.800,0:14:40.640
workbench down so that we can build. Let's use 
the 45°ree roof pieces and replace that roof.

0:14:40.640,0:14:48.880
Be really nice uh to have a little light. 
So, I'm going to drop a torch here.

0:14:48.880,0:15:05.600
Not the best place for it, but it'll work for 
now, and it'll help us see uh what we're building.

0:15:05.600,0:15:16.960
And now that'll be the uh thatch roof bridge. 
Looks like we got this in the wrong place.

0:15:19.600,0:15:28.000
Let's try that again. Something 
out there is killing those boores,

0:15:28.000,0:15:36.880
which is interesting because not sure what would 
be fighting the boores at this point. And I'm not

0:15:36.880,0:15:45.760
sure we want to run into it. Let's go make our bed 
and see if we can't call it a night right here.

0:15:47.840,0:15:53.440
These beds aren't going to do us any 
good. So, let's tear them down. Just

0:15:53.440,0:16:01.200
using the mouse wheel click to break 
it into its component pieces. And we'll

0:16:01.200,0:16:08.000
go to our furniture tab. Drop a bed down 
here. Oh, we don't have our fire yet. So,

0:16:08.000,0:16:16.320
let's run around back. We'll place that fire 
right there. If that is rain that we're hearing,

0:16:16.320,0:16:23.520
it's just the wind. That's good. Uh the 
rain will put our fire out and we would

0:16:23.520,0:16:31.600
need to put a roof over it. Hopefully, we 
can get through the night without that.

0:16:31.600,0:16:40.080
haven't been paying enough attention to well 
both eating, making sure I have food and taking

0:16:40.080,0:16:53.760
advantage of our rested bonus. That's going 
to be more really important as we move on.

0:16:53.760,0:16:57.120
So,

0:16:57.120,0:17:03.200
let's break down this fire so 
we don't have to search. So,

0:17:03.200,0:17:09.920
today we've got a comfort level of four. Um, 
little better than what we had in that basic

0:17:09.920,0:17:21.280
structure. Not sure exactly what gave us the 
extra comfort. I have to look into that. Um,

0:17:21.280,0:17:23.120
all right. We got our rocks back.

0:17:24.960,0:17:32.720
We are starting to outline our island. We can see 
the water. We've been following the water's edge

0:17:32.720,0:17:48.480
and we're just going to keep following it until 
we uh meet our goal of finding the black forest.

0:17:52.040,0:17:53.040
[Music]

0:17:53.040,0:17:59.600
see how far that guy follows us and if he's 
going to be a problem. In the meantime,

0:17:59.600,0:18:11.360
I just want to keep exploring. So, we've 
got a nice weapon. We could make a shield.

0:18:11.360,0:18:19.520
Uh, and a shield would improve our parry 
ability. Next time we encounter a grling,

0:18:19.520,0:18:25.520
try to remember to demonstrate the parry and 
the parry advantage. Here we go. All right,

0:18:25.520,0:18:32.560
come here. Watch him swing. Once he gets 
close, I'm going to block. I want to be

0:18:32.560,0:18:43.680
sure the camera. There we go. Didn't 
get to parry, but we got the block.

0:18:43.680,0:18:51.600
So parrying with the weapon u don't have a 
lot of experience about that with that. I'm

0:18:51.600,0:18:59.840
more familiar with parrying with a a buckler 
or shield. Buckler gives you the advantage of

0:18:59.840,0:19:10.000
extra damage when you parry with a buckler. It's a 
little bit smaller, a little harder to parry with.

0:19:10.000,0:19:12.320
Looking for some bones again.

0:19:15.440,0:19:25.840
Let's do another block here if he'll accommodate 
us. There we go. And you hear that extra sound

0:19:25.840,0:19:34.080
with the block where it kind of makes that symbol 
sound. That is that's our parry. And that gives us

0:19:34.080,0:19:38.480
uh the parry bonus, which 
if we hover over the weapon,

0:19:38.480,0:19:46.800
we can see the parry bonus for this 
weapon is 2x. So, we get double damage.

0:19:46.800,0:19:54.960
Now, if we find more bees, we're 
just don't have enough inventory room

0:19:54.960,0:20:01.200
to pick them up, which is kind of sad. We're going 
to have to start picking and choosing our Oh,

0:20:01.200,0:20:06.320
place stacks. Uh that button, if you have 
something in your inventory that matches

0:20:06.320,0:20:20.160
what's in the chest, it will stack 
those up match on the match type.

0:20:20.160,0:20:26.640
Now, tonight we're going to have to cook 
some more food because we're getting low.

0:20:26.640,0:20:36.400
going to hit um 7 six and we'll eat that 
honey that we have. Now we're out of honey,

0:20:36.400,0:20:40.400
so we'll go back to raspberries. 
But in the meantime, we've got a

0:20:40.400,0:20:52.000
a nice little boost. The honey gives us more 
stamina. I can't remember the exact amount.

0:20:52.000,0:20:55.760
I kind of wandered up into this 
clearing so we could look around.

0:20:56.320,0:21:05.120
Going to head back towards the 
water so that we keep that [Music]

0:21:05.120,0:21:10.720
coastline on our map.

0:21:10.720,0:21:15.920
Put the hammer away so that we run faster.

0:21:15.920,0:21:23.200
And he'll probably follow us and we can take 
care of him when he gets to be a problem.

0:21:26.160,0:21:36.080
That that's our first view of the black 
forest. These pine trees, the ones that look

0:21:36.080,0:21:47.680
like evergreens, they are only found in the black 
forest. So, we've been talking about biomes. The

0:21:47.680,0:21:56.960
game split up into separate areas. Each area is 
considered a biome. And the biome uh has a group

0:21:56.960,0:22:09.600
of elements to it such as in the meadows, the 
first biome that we start in. We have deer bore

0:22:09.600,0:22:17.920
neck. All right, let's see. Did he see us? Oh, 
that's We want to get our bow out. And we scared

0:22:17.920,0:22:27.520
him off. That's too bad. Um, I typically have my 
bow in slot four and my shield in slot three. And

0:22:27.520,0:22:37.120
I hit four and pulled that she that torch out 
instead of my bow. Scared him off. All right,

0:22:37.120,0:22:44.240
we are now close to the Black Forest. So, there's 
there's one of our go major goals. We have found

0:22:44.240,0:22:54.720
the Black Forest. Now, we want to establish a 
home base close to the back forest. Let's go back

0:22:54.720,0:23:02.480
and check out that clearing. That's probably 
a great place for a base. And we had

0:23:02.480,0:23:11.120
uh some abandoned structures there 
that we can use uh to get started.

0:23:13.760,0:23:19.200
uh we could just complete these and 
rebuild any of these existing structures,

0:23:19.200,0:23:28.480
but instead I think we'll build 
our first uh house ourselves.

0:23:28.480,0:23:37.440
The first thing I want to do is establish 
shelter for the night. And let's do that in here.

0:23:37.440,0:23:44.160
And then we'll build right next to this. 
Uh we're I like this spot. We're close to

0:23:44.160,0:23:56.480
the water. Um we're close to the black forest 
and we've got uh plenty of resources around.

0:23:57.440,0:24:05.360
One thing that you'll find out is that as 
you work in an area, so if you're building,

0:24:05.360,0:24:12.640
if you're chopping down trees, if you're um 
leveling the ground with a hoe, which we're

0:24:12.640,0:24:18.880
going to do here in just a minute, all of that 
noise will attract attention from the creatures

0:24:18.880,0:24:30.640
in the area. Sometimes that attention is not 
something that we want. Other times it's okay.

0:24:30.640,0:24:39.760
I'm beginning to wonder how big that black forest 
is. Uh but anyway, if you make that when you do

0:24:39.760,0:24:49.360
that work, that noise is going to draw creatures 
to you. So, since we're close to the black forest,

0:24:49.360,0:24:58.160
we can start drawing creatures out of the black 
forest. uh and will be encountering much tougher

0:24:58.160,0:25:07.520
opponents than we've seen so far. So far, these 
grlings have not caused us a lot of trouble. The

0:25:07.520,0:25:14.800
bores haven't caused us enough tr much trouble. 
The neck pretty easy to take care of. There's our

0:25:14.800,0:25:25.840
Oh, I'm just not sneaking around like I should 
be. All right. If we take this structure, we're

0:25:25.840,0:25:41.840
going to have be right next to the ocean. And 
let's keep going. There's another one over here.

0:25:41.840,0:25:46.880
There's a bee in this one. I can 
hear the beehive. There it is

0:25:46.880,0:26:01.360
right there. You can see it up in that 
corner. We'll leave it alone for now.

0:26:01.360,0:26:07.680
We haven't had our first death yet. I'm 
wondering if we want to explore that black

0:26:07.680,0:26:15.680
forest to see how big it is because it looks 
pretty small. Oh, there's one of the structures.

0:26:15.680,0:26:24.000
You'll find these abandoned stone towers in 
the Black Forest. Uh, and they'll typically be

0:26:24.000,0:26:31.440
housing either gray dwarfs, which we haven't seen 
a grey dwarf yet. They look a lot like grlings,

0:26:31.440,0:26:38.880
but they're much stronger, or skeletons. 
Skeletons are also a challenging opponent

0:26:38.880,0:26:48.560
at this point. As we get stronger, they won't be 
that that hard. Okay, there's our deer. Going to

0:26:48.560,0:26:55.920
try to squat down so we don't scare the other 
two. Switch to our bow. When we do the bow,

0:26:55.920,0:27:08.320
we want to aim high and to the right cuz the 
arrows always drop and float to the left. So,

0:27:08.320,0:27:20.640
there we go. Improving our our uh bow skill 
a little. Oh, and he moved right at the end.

0:27:20.640,0:27:30.880
Coming right at it was missed. Yeah, I'm not going 
to go swimming for it if I kill him in the water.

0:27:30.880,0:27:39.840
You could. I just don't prefer 
to. One more. There we go.

0:27:40.720,0:27:47.600
Now I've got to get rid of stuff to pick up this 
uh going to get plenty more of these trophies.

0:27:47.600,0:27:57.920
So I'm going to throw that down. This deer hide 
is what we need to start making deer armor. Uh

0:27:57.920,0:28:12.400
and we'll be using it for multiple things. Um 
we you'll collect a lot of them. Oh, okay. So,

0:28:12.400,0:28:19.680
there is a troll. That is the toughest guy in 
the Black Forest. If he's heading this way,

0:28:19.680,0:28:23.840
we're leaving. And he is heading this way. So,

0:28:23.840,0:28:35.040
let's get out of here. We are nowhere ready to 
take on a troll at this point in the game. So,

0:28:35.040,0:28:38.880
discretion being the better part of honor.

0:28:38.880,0:28:48.160
We're going to let him uh leave him for another 
day. Uh we will come back and get him eventually,

0:28:48.160,0:29:01.840
just not today. But the other thing we saw 
at the same time we were seeing that troll

0:29:01.840,0:29:07.840
was there was a stone structure off 
in the background of the black forest.

0:29:07.840,0:29:18.560
That stone structure is likely a burial chamber. 
Burial chambers are great sources for treasure

0:29:18.560,0:29:23.440
in the Black Forest. So, we're going to 
want to come back there. That's a really

0:29:23.440,0:29:36.720
good area for us to to return to. So, that 
said, I think we'll be happy if we just make

0:29:39.920,0:29:51.200
um a base over here. We should be far enough 
from that troll that we don't get his attention.

0:29:51.200,0:29:58.080
And yet, we'll be able to go hunt [Music]

0:29:58.080,0:30:08.720
and take him down when we feel like 
we're ready. So, our goal is to have

0:30:08.720,0:30:16.560
deerhide armor before we fight Eek there. 
But if we can manage troll armor, that is a

0:30:16.560,0:30:28.400
much stronger armor and would be much much more 
valuable. All right, let's just do a real quick

0:30:28.400,0:30:41.200
uh base here. So, if we uh if it gets laid on 
us and we're not ready with our with the base

0:30:41.200,0:30:50.560
that we're going to build, our custom house, 
then we'll have a place to spend the night.

0:30:50.560,0:30:59.120
Might let this video go a little bit longer 
and try to get um this initial base built.

0:31:06.560,0:31:11.040
Now, not pretty, but I'm just going 
to slap a roof over this in case it

0:31:11.040,0:31:17.680
starts to rain on us. And we're running 
short on wood. Let's just get the wood

0:31:17.680,0:31:25.680
from this over here. But we're going to 
need our workbench in order to do that.

0:31:28.240,0:31:30.160
You always tear down your workbench,

0:31:30.160,0:31:46.560
move it, set it back up. You never lose 
resources when you break stuff down. Um,

0:31:46.560,0:31:52.640
so it's it's really convenient just 
to transfer that to where you want it.

0:31:54.000,0:32:01.200
I just I switch to repair when I'm 
doing this because it's easier. Oh,

0:32:01.200,0:32:18.320
I didn't see. Did we take any? We'll need to 
check that chest. See if we emptied it out.

0:32:18.320,0:32:21.200
Go away, kid. You're bothering me.

0:32:23.520,0:32:30.480
Yeah, we emptied it. Okay. So, if you 
hover over it, it'll tell you it's empty.

0:32:30.480,0:32:37.280
And we can break it down, too.

0:32:37.280,0:32:41.440
Now, we've got some wood to

0:32:41.440,0:32:48.960
[Music] to continue setting up this structure.

0:32:52.280,0:33:00.640
[Music] going to continue collecting these. 
So, oh, our inventory is full. Let's go

0:33:00.640,0:33:07.440
uh drop a chest in here next to our bed. Just 
create a little foot locker so that we've got

0:33:07.440,0:33:17.280
a place to offload some of our inventory. Oh, 
we need the crafting table. Drop that in here.

0:33:21.360,0:33:29.200
Can I fit it in this way? No.

0:33:29.200,0:33:38.320
All right. Go to furniture chest.

0:33:38.320,0:33:46.720
Put a door on it just to keep the baddies out at 
night. Not that they would necessarily come in,

0:33:46.720,0:33:54.000
but I just feel Oh, that wasn't what I wanted. 
I just feel safer that way. So, just selecting

0:33:54.000,0:34:01.360
the building pieces that uh fit, rotating it to 
match the direction of the floor. Going to shift

0:34:01.360,0:34:11.680
into repair mode and repair the stuff that's here 
just so it looks good. It's functional as it is.

0:34:14.000,0:34:17.200
Um,

0:34:17.200,0:34:25.520
any wood structure that's not covered 
by a roof will decay over time in the

0:34:25.520,0:34:35.200
rain and the elements. Are we 
at a 26? No, we're at a 45.

0:34:35.200,0:34:42.560
There we go. It'll only decay to about half 
health. Um, sometimes it'll get lower if

0:34:42.560,0:34:51.440
something has been pounding on it. You'll find 
the creatures of the biome don't like human

0:34:51.440,0:34:59.040
structures and will tear them down or beat 
on them, get bored, wander off. So sometimes

0:34:59.040,0:35:12.880
things are worse than halfway decayed, but the 
weather typically is just going to do a halfway.

0:35:12.880,0:35:17.280
So as I'm hovering the mouse over each item,

0:35:17.280,0:35:24.400
I'll get the indication of its 
health and whether it needs repaired.

0:35:24.400,0:35:31.840
I'm not replacing these ground ones. I'm not even

0:35:31.840,0:35:40.240
that sure they need to be there.

0:35:40.240,0:35:47.360
Okay, looks like it's almost night 
time. We're going to pick a spot.

0:35:47.360,0:35:56.480
Let's go in here. And we need a new 
tool. Um, so we use the workbench.

0:35:57.360,0:36:05.040
You see, we can make quite a 
few things now that we have um

0:36:05.040,0:36:13.280
we have all of our materials here. Uh one 
of the things I wanted was a shield. So,

0:36:13.280,0:36:20.320
let's craft a wood shield. Can't do it with 
the inventory full. Got to make sure these

0:36:20.320,0:36:26.560
things stay in inventory, but let's offload 
some of this stuff. feathers we'll use later

0:36:26.560,0:36:32.720
for crafting. This neck meat needs to be 
cooked. Got quite a bit of bore meat and

0:36:32.720,0:36:39.280
uh we're almost out, so we need to cook that. 
Notice I haven't been eating. Uh letting my

0:36:39.280,0:36:46.320
health get low. That is always dangerous. We can 
make that beehive now. Our treasure. We're just

0:36:46.320,0:36:54.320
going to stockpile it as we go. Don't know if 
I need that. And a stone. One stone, you know.

0:36:56.800,0:37:04.880
by itself is not great. All right, let's see 
what we've got now. Can we still make that

0:37:04.880,0:37:10.160
shield? Going to make a wood shield. Now, one of 
the things I always missed was this little style

0:37:10.160,0:37:17.840
button here. You can change the style of your 
shield. Kind of like this red and red and black.

0:37:17.840,0:37:23.360
So, I'm going to go with that for my shield. And 
that'll change the default style from this just

0:37:23.360,0:37:33.600
plain wood to this painted wood and craft that 
shield. Um, also you notice the upgrade tab here.

0:37:33.600,0:37:40.800
If we had the materials, we can upgrade these to 
a higher level. The wood shield's going to require

0:37:40.800,0:37:47.840
us to up make an upgrade for our crafting table. 
Looks like any kind of upgrade. We've got to get

0:37:47.840,0:37:57.280
our crafting table to two. And um that's something 
that we're going to do another day. For now, it's

0:37:57.280,0:38:09.840
night time. Let's get some sleep and we'll start 
on what's this going to be? Day four. Day five.

0:38:09.840,0:38:15.360
These dreams are always interesting. I can't 
read fast enough half the time to to finish

0:38:15.360,0:38:24.080
the long ones. But I see it enough often enough 
because they repeat that eventually I can read

0:38:24.080,0:38:30.720
it all. Day five. All right, let's go 
ahead and go a little bit further. Oh,

0:38:30.720,0:38:37.200
there's Hugenan. What's he got to say 
today? Hugan, not Hugenan. I've crafted

0:38:37.200,0:38:43.920
a shield. And it talks about parrying. We've 
been doing the pairing and the staggering.

0:38:43.920,0:38:51.440
If you do that perfect parry, it's really 
good uh skill to develop. It's not really

0:38:51.440,0:39:01.280
that hard to do. Just a matter of time. 
All right. What do we need to make the hoe

0:39:01.280,0:39:07.280
cuz that's what we want. Let's go back 
to craft. We want a hoe to start. We

0:39:07.280,0:39:14.640
need more wood. Let's go gra some stones. 
We're going to need lots more wood. So,

0:39:14.640,0:39:26.080
we're going to gather stone and we're going to 
chop wood. Now, chopping the wood is something

0:39:26.080,0:39:32.320
that could definitely get the attention if 
we're close enough. The troll is going to

0:39:32.320,0:39:40.400
hear us chopping these trees down and he's 
going to come after us with a vengeance.

0:39:42.720,0:39:50.720
You're going to collect a lot of these beach seeds 
that you just saw go by. Eventually, uh, when we

0:39:50.720,0:40:01.040
have the materials, we can craft a cultivator that 
allow us to replant trees. And so, we can replant

0:40:01.040,0:40:09.120
these beach trees that we're cutting down. You can 
see that that chopping trees takes a lot longer

0:40:09.120,0:40:20.960
time. than the scrub wood. Never have figured 
out the tradeoff of how many scrub trees I need

0:40:20.960,0:40:27.200
to replace a full tree. Now, 
that big oak tree over there,

0:40:27.200,0:40:32.320
that'll give us a lot of wood. 
Uh, and it'll give us fine wood,

0:40:32.320,0:40:48.800
but I'm pretty sure that the axe that we're 
using not strong enough to cut down an oak tree.

0:40:48.800,0:40:55.760
Notice how the world does a 
little shake as we're chopping.

0:40:55.760,0:41:02.640
If that troll were to come up, each 
of his steps will do that world shake

0:41:02.640,0:41:12.760
uh and give you kind of a forewarning 
that he's coming up behind you.

0:41:12.760,0:41:19.200
[Music]

0:41:19.200,0:41:25.720
But in the meantime, I think Oh, there we 
go. Let's see if we can get him. [Music]

0:41:27.920,0:41:35.840
Now, deer are almost always in pairs. So, 
if you see one, it's almost always another

0:41:35.840,0:41:50.160
one. I don't know if he's behind that tree. 
Ah, got them both. And I hear another one.

0:41:50.160,0:41:54.080
Scared him. Got him.

0:41:55.360,0:42:03.600
See that little exclamation point? Now, there's 
our first deer trophy. Deer trophies are crafting

0:42:03.600,0:42:11.760
materials, and they're also what we'll need 
to summon the boss of the biome, ether, for

0:42:11.760,0:42:27.680
our final fight in the meadows. I say our final 
fight. It's not the final fight. It is just the uh

0:42:27.680,0:42:31.760
we we'll always be able to return to 
the biome. We we'll always be fighting

0:42:31.760,0:42:37.120
granings and neck. Uh but once we 
fought ether, we'll move on to the

0:42:37.120,0:42:45.600
black forest and a new biome. Gonna 
repair real quick while I'm close by

0:42:45.600,0:42:52.800
and offload a few more of these materials. 
Oh, we need a cooking station, don't we? Now,

0:42:52.800,0:42:59.920
hit place stacks and it matches stuff up. 
We've got a little bit of wood here. Uh,

0:42:59.920,0:43:06.320
let's see if we can find some of those stones.

0:43:06.320,0:43:12.720
And since we're in the vicinity, let's 
test our axe on this oak tree. I'm almost

0:43:12.720,0:43:16.960
sure it's going to say too hard, 
which means that we're not able to

0:43:16.960,0:43:33.520
cut it too hard. But once we have the 
proper tool, that is a good source.

0:43:33.520,0:43:37.200
I don't remember how many stone we 
needed, but I think we probably have

0:43:37.200,0:43:48.560
enough to make our hoe. We'll use the 
hoe to level our ground and start uh

0:43:48.560,0:43:55.600
our home base.

0:43:55.600,0:44:00.480
Probably build right in this area right here.

0:44:05.680,0:44:10.960
There we go.

0:44:10.960,0:44:20.720
Now we can do level ground, raise ground, and I 
didn't catch that third option, but we can find

0:44:20.720,0:44:26.560
out pretty easy. Let's put the hoe up here in 
slot number one. We're not going to be needing

0:44:26.560,0:44:36.480
that torch right away. And we probably don't 
need it in a hot bar. And I think I hear Hugan.

0:44:36.480,0:44:47.280
He wants to tell us about the hoe tool 
used for landscaping. Thank you, Hugan.

0:44:47.280,0:44:51.040
He does have useful information. 
If it's your first time playing,

0:44:51.040,0:44:56.960
highly recommend you read what he has to 
say. So, we're just going to level out the

0:44:56.960,0:45:05.440
ground for the new house. And our this first 
house, I'm going to build just a real simple

0:45:05.440,0:45:16.240
structure. Want to give us a little bit more 
room than what we have in that Viking lodge. Um,

0:45:16.240,0:45:23.360
and I want a what the Viking lodge doesn't 
have, which is a place for a fireplace inside.

0:45:25.680,0:45:34.000
and [Music] a chimney because if you don't have 
a chimney, you'll get smoked out and that'll

0:45:34.000,0:45:41.120
kill you. All right, let's start with our crafting 
table. As always, we're just going to drop a new

0:45:41.120,0:45:50.800
one here in the middle and we're going to outline 
the building using these wood beam 2 meters.

0:45:53.200,0:46:01.600
Uh, of course my leveling doesn't match the 
contour of the land. The land has a natural

0:46:01.600,0:46:12.320
contour to it. So like when you level ground or 
if you dig a pit. What do we got here? One, two,

0:46:12.320,0:46:26.560
three, four, five by three. That's a good first 
house. We don't need these ground pieces. I put

0:46:26.560,0:46:34.560
that in the wrong place. I jumped the gun, let 
it snap into place naturally, and I got in too

0:46:34.560,0:46:44.560
big a hurry. We don't need it, but it's just kind 
of handy uh so that we get everything. Otherwise,

0:46:44.560,0:46:52.080
if we set down floorboards, the dirt may stick 
up through. Um, if we didn't level the ground,

0:46:52.080,0:46:58.720
the grass would come up through the floorboards. 
Just not a pretty. And we want a little clean

0:46:58.720,0:47:08.800
build. All right. So, that's all that wood that we 
chopped down. Let's go get some more. Uh, chopping

0:47:08.800,0:47:27.440
trees is something that you will do a lot of 
throughout the game. There I am not eating again.

0:47:27.440,0:47:32.240
And we're going to be cutting down a lot of trees

0:47:32.240,0:47:40.000
to build this house. Several hundred 
wood. There's another deer over there.

0:47:41.920,0:47:44.480
It's another nice thing about this location is

0:47:44.480,0:47:53.680
there's plenty of deer in the 
area. Now, where's his buddy?

0:47:53.680,0:48:00.720
I don't see him. He's usually 
in the general vicinity.

0:48:00.720,0:48:07.440
Switch to sneak. So, maybe I can 
find him without scaring him off,

0:48:07.440,0:48:09.200
but I'm not seeing him.

0:48:10.400,0:48:20.880
Maybe he's the one that ran earlier. I do hear 
a snarl from somebody coming up behind us. Let's

0:48:20.880,0:48:31.040
grab these mushrooms. I don't see a deer. 
There's a boar, though. Still good to get

0:48:31.040,0:48:45.600
these bore when we can. [Music] Again, we'll 
use these scrap leathers throughout the game.

0:48:45.600,0:48:56.320
[Music] Oh, I think the snarls we were 
here and wore the was the boar. This

0:48:56.320,0:49:07.760
boar runstone. Yeah. No. Yeah, the wild boar. 
Um, typically the first time you encounter it,

0:49:07.760,0:49:15.120
you'll find several boar around it like 
we did. The creatures of the meadows will

0:49:15.120,0:49:26.560
respawn at a certain time after you kill them. 
However, that creatures that spawn next to that

0:49:26.560,0:49:33.520
uh stone probably aren't going to come 
back. Not that you won't find more there,

0:49:33.520,0:49:40.880
but you'll never find that initial amount 
like you do the first time you encounter it.

0:49:40.880,0:49:48.000
At least that's been my experience. 
Your experience certainly may vary.

0:49:48.000,0:49:55.040
Didn't mean to chop that bush up. Uh don't want to 
destroy the raspberry bushes cuz the raspberries

0:49:55.040,0:50:06.080
will regrow uh given a few days time. And having 
some close to our house is really handy. Ah,

0:50:06.080,0:50:15.360
there we go. Now that's that's real handy when you 
chop down one tree and you end up with multiples.

0:50:15.360,0:50:21.360
And then we also picked up feathers, which you 
often find when you chop down trees that you get

0:50:21.360,0:50:30.640
feathers. Real handy for making uh better arrows 
than the wood arrows that we're using. We could

0:50:30.640,0:50:46.240
be making flint arrows. We have the flint for 
it, but I think the wood arrows suffice. [Music]

0:50:46.240,0:50:57.760
Again, you'll be chopping wood throughout your 
time in Valheim. You always need more wood.

0:50:57.760,0:51:10.160
So there's seldom a time that you don't

0:51:10.160,0:51:18.320
lots and lots of online designs for different 
types of homes. Uh I build some pretty basic

0:51:18.320,0:51:24.480
structures. Sometimes I like to take my 
time and and build more advanced structure,

0:51:24.480,0:51:30.640
but for this purpose, we're just going to 
stick to some basic ones. I encourage you

0:51:30.640,0:51:39.520
to check out the advanced designs on site on 
online. Some really, really inventive people

0:51:39.520,0:51:47.440
out there making really nice structures. 
All right, let's drop a door in here.

0:51:47.440,0:51:57.920
Uh, and let's put uh directly opposite 
that, let's put our fireplace over here.

0:51:57.920,0:52:08.080
Um, just going to create a little 
notch here for the fireplace.

0:52:08.080,0:52:13.680
And then we'll go to the miscellaneous 
and drop a fire right there. So,

0:52:13.680,0:52:38.960
we've got our basic walls and let's 
go and look at putting a roof on it.

0:52:38.960,0:52:39.120
[Music]

0:52:39.120,0:52:46.720
So, I'm going to leave some open air so we have 
windows. We have a view of the outside. Uh, that's

0:52:46.720,0:52:57.600
why I'm using these pillars on top. Now, let's put 
some rafters across for a roof. We're going to do

0:52:57.600,0:53:07.600
a simple buted roof where the roof ends right up 
against the side of the house. Um, if you want

0:53:07.600,0:53:26.800
to get fancier. Oh, I missed. Uh, doing a nice 
roof overhang makes a much more attractive home.

0:53:26.800,0:53:37.440
Uh, this frame we'll use for our roof 
pieces. Going to do a 26 in roof just cuz

0:53:37.440,0:53:45.120
uh we've got enough height and the 45 
gives us a nice huge vated ceiling,

0:53:45.120,0:53:52.080
but not something that we need right 
now. If you were building twotory,

0:53:52.080,0:54:00.880
it would probably be good. Out of 
wood again, it won't be the last time.

0:54:03.600,0:54:10.800
Let's grab our rested buff. It only takes about 
30 seconds next to the fire under a shelter. When

0:54:10.800,0:54:16.400
we get that sheltered icon that you see in the 
upper right corner, wait about 30 seconds and

0:54:16.400,0:54:26.080
you'll get your arrested buff. That allows us to 
increase skills, stamina, uh, all that improves

0:54:26.080,0:54:34.400
with the rested buff. It's really important as the 
game moves on that you keep that rested buff on.

0:54:34.400,0:54:41.360
Uh right now I want it for the stamina gain. 
Uh because we use up so much stamina chopping

0:54:41.360,0:54:51.600
wood. Uh two for tree. Each swing is going to 
hit both trees. So it takes half of the effort

0:54:51.600,0:55:02.080
to bring down two trees. kind of like when we 
get the bonus tree knocking down another tree

0:55:02.080,0:55:10.320
also. Oh, that was close. Watch where the 
tree falls cuz if the tree falls on you,

0:55:10.320,0:55:17.120
it'll kill you. Many a death in Valheim 
due to trees falling. Probably one of

0:55:17.120,0:55:21.680
the most common causes of death in the early game.

0:55:22.880,0:55:32.160
I don't know if I can get two on that. See, 
our swing is going underneath. Would be nice.

0:55:32.160,0:55:36.080
Could stand here.

0:55:36.080,0:55:49.680
There we go. Might as well maximize the 
effort efficiency. Oh, we're missing.

0:55:49.680,0:55:51.040
But we can stand here.

0:55:53.680,0:56:00.480
Also, you notice I'll beat on the stumps after 
they're done. I want to remove these stumps

0:56:00.480,0:56:06.080
because if you leave them lying around, it just 
takes extra time for the game to draw. If your

0:56:06.080,0:56:11.680
machine's a little bit taxed, all that extra 
stuff that has to be drawn will start to slow

0:56:11.680,0:56:24.160
it down. Broke our axe. Let's go repair. Uh, 
so I just take it take it down so that I can

0:56:24.160,0:56:40.720
repair as fast as possible. No, so that 
my screen draws doesn't start to lag.

0:56:40.720,0:56:44.560
Running out of daylight. We were 
not going to finish this today.

0:56:45.120,0:56:51.200
going to wrap it up at night time here. Uh 
so we'll be stopping soon. Tomorrow we'll

0:56:51.200,0:57:01.120
continue chopping trees and building that 
home base. From here we're going to continue

0:57:01.120,0:57:10.880
on our goal of I didn't want to take that 
bush out. continue on our goal. Taking out

0:57:10.880,0:57:20.480
the deer so that we can get that upgraded armor

0:57:20.480,0:57:28.000
and we'll probably start dipping our head 
into the black forest. Maybe we can sneak

0:57:28.000,0:57:38.720
into that burial chamber and see what's in 
store for us there. In the meantime, y'all

0:57:38.720,0:57:49.360
have a great day. I'm Grandpa Bud and thanks for 
joining me in playing Valheim. Night, everybody.
