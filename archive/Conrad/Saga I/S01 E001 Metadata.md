## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The Valkyrie dropped me in the Great Green. My pockets were empty. My hands were cold. I found a stone and some wood. I made a club to ward off the boars. By nightfall, I had a roof. It is a start.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad, once a warrior of renown, now stands as a ghost in the Tenth World. He must prove his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel. Every tree felled is a defiance; every fire lit is a prayer for survival.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as he takes his first steps into the Meadows. We will secure the basic tools of survival, face the first of the forest's beasts, and raise a roof to keep the night at bay.
