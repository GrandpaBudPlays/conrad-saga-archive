## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The peace of the Meadows is a lie. As Conrad completes his ancestral hall, the Great Stag Eikthyr sends his first warning. In this chronicle, we master the art of the Viking hearth, secure the bounty of the bees, and defend our home against the first of many raids.

An old man knows that a sturdy roof keeps the rain out, but a sturdy wall keeps the shadows at bay. The trial is intensifying, and the halls of Valhalla are watching how we hold our ground.
