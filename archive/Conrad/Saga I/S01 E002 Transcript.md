## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
A new dawn breaks over the 10th World. Conrad spends the morning at the hearth, reflecting on the lessons the Allfather has already provided. The Meadows are vast, but the call of the Black Forest is growing louder.

In this chronicle, Conrad shares the wisdom of the stones and the secrets of the map—knowledge earned from a lifetime of survival. We push further into the wilds to find another altar of the Elder and prove that even an exiled man can find his way through the dark. The journey is slow, the thoughts are deep, and the weapons are getting sharper.

### 👴 ELDER’S WISDOM (Practical Survival)

* **[02:59] - The Weaver’s Diet:** A detailed explanation of managing the mix between stamina and health. It covers how to consume three different food types—specifically red, white, and yellow sources—to balance your physical needs.
* **[09:11] - Loot of the Fallen:** Wisdom on the value of finding arrows and treasure in abandoned chests. Flint arrows are highlighted as a significant early-game upgrade over basic wood arrows.
* **[11:32] - The Strength of Stars:** An observation on "starred" creatures, noting that they are larger, possess more health, and provide more resources upon defeat than their standard counterparts.
* **[14:52] - Reading the Heavens:** A guide to telling time using the sun's position relative to your mini-map, where 3:00 represents morning, 6:00 is noon, and 9:00 is evening.
* **[21:49] - The Night's Aggression:** A warning that the world becomes more dangerous and aggressive once the "Cold" debuff appears, signaling the arrival of nighttime.
* **[28:11] - The Life of the Forge:** Instructions on using the workbench to repair tools and armor. Unlike torches, which burn out, your metal and wood equipment can be maintained indefinitely at a station.

### 🎞️ ABRIDGED SERIES GOLD (Character & Hooks)

* **[01:27] - The Warm Welcome:** "Welcome back. I'm Grandpa and I'm here to play Valheim." — A simple, consistent opening that establishes the mentor persona.
* **[04:47] - Avoiding the Lore-Breaker:** "I'm going to try to avoid [spoilers] whenever I can." — Showing a commitment to an authentic, first-time discovery experience for the audience.
* **[07:24] - The Grandpa-ism:** Insisting on calling them "raspberries" despite the in-game text, adding a touch of personal character to the commentary.
* **[10:13] - The Old Man's Wind:** Maintaining a steady pace while exploring and emphasizing the need to keep stamina in reserve "just in case you encounter something you need to fight".
* **[22:01] - The Humble Admission:** "Kind of messed up by not getting a shelter before nightfall." — An honest moment of vulnerability when caught unprepared by the setting sun.
* **[27:40] - The Midnight Duel:** A high-tension moment facing the night with a broken hammer and a club on the verge of snapping, forcing a potential "fist-fight" finish to the day.

### ⚒️ PRODUCTION NOTES
Abridged Potential: High. This episode captures the essential "First Steps" arc, moving from a naked exile to a sheltered warrior.

Thumbnail/Hook Idea: "The Wisdom of the Hearth" — Featuring Conrad at the cooking spit or workbench. It leans into the "Mentor" persona more effectively than the Eikthyr altar shot, as the altar discovery is a brief moment compared to the focus on survival basics.

Persona Opportunity: At [14:44], you discuss telling time by the sun. This is a prime spot to use the "Elder's Wisdom" hook to explain how a veteran tracks the daylight without a clock.

Lore Integration: When encountering the Abandoned Village at, the narrative description could be strengthened by using the term "Othala" to describe the search for an ancestral home or the foundations of a new sanctuary.

Character Flaw Hook: Use the [07:24] "Raspberries" debate as a lighthearted character moment. It reinforces the "Relatably Flawed" trait—a stubborn grandpa who calls things by his own names despite what the "game" says.

Technical Note: The audio "winds of the North" disclaimer is a great touch. It maintains the "Practical Survivalist" voice even when addressing real-world recording issues.

### Thoughts on Development for Grandpa:

Based on the analysis of your first journey into the Meadows, here are the primary areas for development:

* **Persona Consistency:** One of the greatest opportunities is bridging the gap between explaining technical game mechanics and staying in the immersive voice of an exile. Instead of referring to "stamina bars," framing these as "an old man's wind" keeps the audience inside the story.
* **Winding Down the Day:** Using the in-game sunset as a natural trigger for reflection. Transitioning from the frantic pace of building to a quiet, hearthside moment allows your "Practical Survivalist" persona to shine through storytelling.
* **The "Elder’s Wisdom" Anchor:** Teaching the audience is a natural strength of your brand. Framing tips—like the danger of beehives or the importance of the Rested buff—as lessons for the "Heirs" makes the guidance feel like a shared family legacy rather than a tutorial.
* **Vocal Presence:** While you've noted that early recordings have a "vintage" quality, maintaining a steady, mentor-like energy (even when battling a cold) helps establish the authority of the "Grandpa" character.
* **The Authentic Sign-Off:** Your natural closing, *"I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. Have a good one,"* is the most important part of your speaker development. It serves as a "True North" that prevents the persona from feeling like a forced character and keeps it grounded in who you are.


## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:01:27.600,0:01:35.200
All right, let's get started. Welcome back. 
I'm Grandpa and I'm here to play Valheim. So,

0:01:35.200,0:01:52.640
let's start the game. We're going to continue with 
Conrad. We're going to continue in Terra Conrad.

0:01:52.640,0:02:00.880
So, picking up where we left off. We had just 
created our first shelter and gone through our

0:02:00.880,0:02:10.240
first night. Let's go ahead and look at uh cooking 
some food. So, we want to bring up our hammer.

0:02:10.240,0:02:21.760
Go to the crafting menu. We're going to build a 
cooking station. Put this over the fire. And now

0:02:21.760,0:02:32.240
we're able to craft craft. We're able to cook. So 
we've got two different kinds of meat here. This

0:02:32.240,0:02:40.800
game is going to automatically pick which meat we 
cook. So let's put it on the spit by pointing at

0:02:40.800,0:02:51.760
the step and say cook item. We could put the meat 
up here. in a numbered slot and then tell it which

0:02:51.760,0:02:59.360
one that we wanted. Uh so while this is cooking, 
we're just going to wait for it to finish cooking.

0:02:59.360,0:03:08.720
This is going to give us a uh high health food 
source that we can eat to improve our overall

0:03:08.720,0:03:15.920
health. We hear that sound, we know it's done. We 
hit E to take it off. And we've got some cooked

0:03:15.920,0:03:27.440
bore meat. Hitting number five, we can add bore 
meat. Hitting number four, we add the neck meat.

0:03:27.440,0:03:33.760
And while we're waiting, I'm going to write click 
on this food to eat it. The other thing we could

0:03:33.760,0:03:41.440
do is we can put it up here in a numbered slot 
and then we can just hit that number when we eat

0:03:41.440,0:03:55.200
it. We can Let's pick that up. Let's cook 
the last of our food with four and five.

0:03:55.200,0:04:04.480
And let's put this up here. So, we're able 
to consume three foods. We can consume three

0:04:04.480,0:04:13.680
uh different kinds like we have here which 
we currently have uh bore meat, a mushroom,

0:04:13.680,0:04:21.280
and a raspberry. That gives us 
a red, a white, and a yellow.

0:04:21.280,0:04:28.800
But we could also do two reds and a yellow or 
two yellows or two whites. We can mix it up any

0:04:28.800,0:04:37.280
way we want. We can do all three. And that's 
how you manage your mix between stamina and

0:04:37.280,0:04:47.440
um health. And then well, we'll get into 
that later. That's u a bit of a spoiler.

0:04:47.440,0:04:53.520
I don't really want to spend a lot of time on 
spoilers. I'm not process pro promising that

0:04:53.520,0:05:04.640
I won't create some spoilers, but uh I'm going to 
try to avoid them whenever I can. All right. Now,

0:05:04.640,0:05:11.920
we're going to want that beehive for 
now. Let's just leave it here. And today,

0:05:11.920,0:05:19.280
our goal is going to be discovery. We want to see 
what we can discover on the map. Hopefully, we can

0:05:19.280,0:05:26.720
find a little better shelter. It'd be great if we 
could find the edge of the black forest. And we'll

0:05:26.720,0:05:34.240
look for a more permanent place for our home base. 
Right now, we'll just keep coming back to this bed

0:05:34.240,0:05:44.400
icon for our home base, unless we get too far 
away, in which case uh we'll just uh make a new

0:05:44.400,0:05:52.400
shelter. So, for now, we just want to look around, 
see what we can find. We've encountered two of the

0:05:52.400,0:06:02.720
creatures of the meadows. Uh, we've seen the 
third creature, the deer. Uh, don't remember

0:06:02.720,0:06:09.360
off the top of my head how much they are, how many 
there are. That's the main ones that I can think

0:06:09.360,0:06:23.040
of is the the grings and the neck and the deer. 
And we're going to harvest those for resources.

0:06:23.040,0:06:27.040
So, we want deer for their 
meat and the leather armor,

0:06:27.040,0:06:33.040
which is a little better than the 
armor that we get from the boar.

0:06:34.400,0:06:44.880
Um, we can create some armor with that bore 
leather. Uh, similar to what we have on now.

0:06:44.880,0:06:52.800
We're currently wearing the bore armor 
tunic. We can make legs and a hood if we

0:06:52.800,0:07:02.080
get enough armor. All right. Going to hit 
hard. Access my weapon. Come up behind him

0:07:02.080,0:07:10.320
and take him out.

0:07:10.320,0:07:14.960
I'm going to gather as many of these 
raspberries as I can. Raspberries. I'm

0:07:14.960,0:07:22.480
going to call them raspberries. Can't help 
it. Um, but they are called raspberries.

0:07:24.720,0:07:29.760
Now, if we wanted to know where this 
nice large group of raspberry is,

0:07:29.760,0:07:37.280
we could come we could mark our map and 
just drop a spot there and we'll put a

0:07:37.280,0:07:44.880
RB for raspberry. Now, if we need more 
raspberries, we can just come back. Uh,

0:07:44.880,0:07:50.000
looks like we're going in circles here. 
We're headed back towards where we started.

0:07:50.000,0:07:56.720
Let's go ahead and proceed with uh a westward 
exploration and let's see what's out there.

0:07:56.720,0:08:02.640
That gold arrow in the mini map or mini map 
up here, that gold arrow points the direction

0:08:02.640,0:08:15.760
we're heading. We're just going to head that off 
to the west and try to keep up that direction.

0:08:15.760,0:08:18.480
Here's some more abandoned structures.

0:08:19.920,0:08:27.680
Most of the abandoned structures that you find 
in the meadows are completely harmless. You

0:08:27.680,0:08:33.760
will run across some, probably not at the 
beginning, but later in the game, that are

0:08:33.760,0:08:40.560
a little more dangerous. I'm not going to tell 
you what that is, unless we encounter one. Don't

0:08:40.560,0:08:47.840
want to spoil anything for you. I always like to 
look them over in case there's a chest in there.

0:08:48.480,0:08:55.840
Tre chests will often give us some buried 
treasure. And we also want to keep an eye out

0:08:55.840,0:09:05.120
for the bees because we don't uh want those bees. 
All right, we can use that. We've got some gold.

0:09:05.120,0:09:11.520
That'll come in handy later in the game when we 
find a vendor. We've got some arrows. The arrows

0:09:11.520,0:09:20.640
will come in real handy once we have created our 
first bow. And the flint arrow is a little more

0:09:20.640,0:09:29.760
a little stronger than the initial arrow that 
we'll be able to build, which is a wood arrow.

0:09:29.760,0:09:34.160
I like to check these out in case there's some 
bones here cuz bones are kind of hard to come

0:09:34.160,0:09:47.040
by in the early game. Uh, but they are useful 
for making items such as capes and armor. Uh,

0:09:47.040,0:10:01.280
it's just a good crafting item to 
have is a good supply of bones.

0:10:01.280,0:10:07.200
Just going to keep pushing through. 
God, visibility is really low today. Uh,

0:10:07.200,0:10:13.600
would be wonderful if we could see a little 
further. Oh, a little bit about stamina. I

0:10:13.600,0:10:20.560
like to run as much as I can. Um, it's a good 
habit to always maintain a certain amount of

0:10:20.560,0:10:29.600
stamina just in case you encounter something 
you need to fight. You don't want to end up

0:10:29.600,0:10:39.840
completely drained of stamina and then you need 
to swing your weapon and you can't swing it.

0:10:39.840,0:10:51.840
Okay. Can I hit control key to sneak? See if 
I can sneak up behind this guy, this deer,

0:10:51.840,0:10:59.120
cuz we can certainly use that armor. 
Going to let my stamina go up. Really

0:10:59.120,0:11:04.960
wonder why these deer sound like dogs, 
but hey, that's the way it is. Yeah,

0:11:04.960,0:11:13.600
my skills not high enough yet for taking 
him out. All right, here's an abandoned

0:11:13.600,0:11:22.640
village. It's kind of cool. We typically 
find a boar around here. And this is our

0:11:22.640,0:11:32.000
first starred creature. Notice how he has that 
one star. That means he's a little bit bigger.

0:11:32.000,0:11:44.080
More more health. Drops uh more items. 
Um eventually when we have a base we can

0:11:44.080,0:11:53.760
tame those boores and they will quit attacking 
us. They'll become friendly. They would fight

0:11:53.760,0:12:03.200
uh anything that would fight us unless it's 
another boar. Uh but we can raise bores and

0:12:03.200,0:12:19.920
breed them. Uh and then we have an endless 
supply of bore meat. Very handy for later game.

0:12:19.920,0:12:27.440
All right, what do we got in here? No bees.

0:12:27.440,0:12:37.120
Uh, more treasure and more flint. And so 
amber is not good for much of anything

0:12:37.120,0:12:48.960
other than its monetary value. We can trade 
it in with the vendor. Don't see any beehives.

0:12:48.960,0:12:54.320
And we get some more treasure.

0:12:54.320,0:13:00.560
Now we could drop a

0:13:00.560,0:13:06.240
Oh, I see see that raspberry flashing 40 
counting down down here in the corner.

0:13:06.240,0:13:11.360
That means our food's about to run out. 
It's time to eat. Let's go ahead and hit

0:13:11.360,0:13:18.400
seven. And let's hit a six to get us 
another mushroom. Now we're out of

0:13:18.400,0:13:27.120
mushrooms. We're going to need another 
food in that slot. So, let's put the

0:13:27.120,0:13:33.840
netmeat in there. So, these numbered slots, 
that's our heart bar. This our inventory page

0:13:33.840,0:13:41.200
that we access with the tab key. And anything 
that we drop in here, we can hit that number to

0:13:41.200,0:13:48.960
access that item. So, we've got one for our torch, 
and then we put it away, and two for the hammer,

0:13:48.960,0:13:58.720
and get it out and put it away, etc. We want 
to eat the food. We can go five, six, or seven.

0:13:58.720,0:14:07.520
This is not a bad spot to come back to. And we 
could uh convert this house. Have to tear down

0:14:07.520,0:14:15.920
these beds. They're really useless. You can't use 
them. But they do break down into their resources.

0:14:15.920,0:14:22.640
And so we can use it to make a new bed after we 
destroy it. And that all would require a crafting

0:14:22.640,0:14:33.600
table. For now, let's just mark this village on 
our map. I'm just double click, give it a name,

0:14:33.600,0:14:43.680
and then we know where to come back to. Let's 
keep heading west just to see what's out here.

0:14:43.680,0:14:49.040
So, here's a little hint. Uh, I'd 
like to know how late in the day it

0:14:49.040,0:14:56.960
is. And unless you keep an eye on your 
rested bonus or your food as a timer,

0:14:56.960,0:15:07.520
it's hard to know the time of day. But if you 
look at the sun, you will and then your mini map,

0:15:07.520,0:15:14.960
your mini map arrow kind of tells you what time 
it is. So, well, that covers up the mini map,

0:15:14.960,0:15:21.600
but starting over here on the right side, 
what would be 3:00 on a clock is the first

0:15:21.600,0:15:30.320
thing in the morning traveling around to 6:00 
would be noon. And then at 9:00 on the map,

0:15:30.320,0:15:37.840
it would be evening. So, if we face the sun, 
we can tell we're just about midday. We can

0:15:37.840,0:15:46.880
keep exploring for a while. Then we'll come back 
here and try to make that house our new shelter.

0:15:46.880,0:15:51.040
You can read these runstones to learn 
a little bit about the lore of the

0:15:51.040,0:16:08.560
world. U very interesting. I'll leave 
that to you to read and we'll head on

0:16:08.560,0:16:13.040
like to take those guys out. If we don't, 
they just follow us around and harass

0:16:13.040,0:16:19.600
us. They catch us when we haven't eaten 
and they can easily kill us. Otherwise,

0:16:19.600,0:16:26.720
they're pretty easily to deal with. 
Always want to keep your food up to

0:16:26.720,0:16:45.200
speed. I can hear the ocean now. So, 
oh, and here is another ether altar.

0:16:45.200,0:16:53.280
So, this is probably going to say exactly the 
same thing. A hunt his kin. Oh, we can see

0:16:53.280,0:16:58.000
uh the other land out there. 
And if we check our map now,

0:16:58.000,0:17:04.240
we can see that we've got one ocean here 
and one ocean here. Kind of getting the

0:17:04.240,0:17:11.360
boundaries of this first little island that 
we're on. Could be big, could be small. We

0:17:11.360,0:17:19.200
don't know till we've ran around the whole 
thing to find out. Let's get these mushrooms.

0:17:26.000,0:17:30.400
I'm going to go with the 
two meat thing for now. Um,

0:17:30.400,0:17:37.120
when that mushroom runs 
out, we'll double up on meat

0:17:37.120,0:17:41.360
and

0:17:41.360,0:17:48.400
uh it'll give us a higher health. Okay, feathers. 
Feathers are something that we're going to collect

0:17:48.400,0:17:56.480
a lot of because we need them to make arrows like 
the flint arrow. Uh any of the better arrows. We

0:17:56.480,0:18:03.280
can make a basic wood arrow, the weakest in 
the game, but we'll want to get better arrows

0:18:03.280,0:18:13.680
later on. And we'll need feathers in order to 
craft those arrows. There's a twostar neck.

0:18:16.560,0:18:22.400
Now, you probably noticed my uh Oh, 
and there's our first trophy. So,

0:18:22.400,0:18:29.840
we picked up a neck trophy. Each 
animal type will drop a trophy. Uh,

0:18:29.840,0:18:36.320
and you can collect those trophies. Some of them 
are valuable. Some of them, like the neck trophy,

0:18:36.320,0:18:43.120
I've yet to find a use for. I still 
hang on to them in CA just in case.

0:18:45.040,0:19:05.200
Ah, hear that noise? There's another beehive. So, 
we aren't going to want to live in this building.

0:19:05.200,0:19:09.840
But I can see the light fading. We're 
going to want to make a shelter here.

0:19:10.880,0:19:15.680
Sounds like there's a beehive 
in this building, too. Yeah,

0:19:15.680,0:19:22.960
we got another beehive. We're going to come 
back and collect these beehives. They're very,

0:19:22.960,0:19:38.160
very helpful because we can they'll make 
honey for us. We can collect that honey

0:19:38.160,0:19:52.640
and it's one of the highest tiered 
stamina foods for the biome.

0:19:52.640,0:19:59.760
Got another onear bore there.

0:20:11.040,0:20:17.040
I hadn't mentioned this before, but you see 
these little stars coming up that shows you where

0:20:17.040,0:20:24.400
uh drops, resource drops are. Like when 
an animal dies, it creates resources.

0:20:24.960,0:20:32.880
Um, all right. Let's probably going 
to have to make shelter here. Uh,

0:20:32.880,0:20:39.200
we waited a little late in the day. 
The sun is practically down. So, let's

0:20:39.200,0:20:50.800
uh just make a quick shelter. We don't 
have any rocks. That's That's a problem.

0:20:50.800,0:20:52.960
We need stone.

0:20:55.840,0:21:03.760
And we need five stone in order to make 
a fire. So until we get that five stone,

0:21:03.760,0:21:11.920
we're going to be kind of vulnerable 
as night comes on and more dangerous

0:21:11.920,0:21:21.280
creatures come out to attack us. All 
right, he'll hit run away and come back.

0:21:24.160,0:21:30.800
And the boar does the same thing. He'll hit 
and run. Thought there was a stone there,

0:21:30.800,0:21:41.040
but I guess not. It gets hard to see 
these stones. Let's use our torch

0:21:41.040,0:21:49.680
so we can see better. that you feel cold 
means it's now nighttime and the world gets

0:21:49.680,0:22:01.520
more aggressive at night. So, kind of messed 
up by not getting a shelter before nightfall.

0:22:01.520,0:22:06.080
If we could just find some stone

0:22:06.080,0:22:11.040
and get a fire, we could build 
that shelter like we did last time.

0:22:12.160,0:22:20.160
All right. A good place to find stone is anywhere 
you see the elevation of the land shift like this.

0:22:20.160,0:22:28.720
There would typically be some exposed stone. I 
think that's five. Yep. All right. Let's just

0:22:28.720,0:22:39.600
put our uh let's put our fire right here. We're 
going to switch to our hammer. Create a fire.

0:22:41.440,0:22:43.760
Then we need a workbench so that we can build our

0:22:43.760,0:22:51.200
shelter. We always have to 
have a workbench to build.

0:22:51.200,0:23:04.880
Looking for level ground. There we go. Going to 
do the same basic shelter that we did last time.

0:23:04.880,0:23:08.720
Get our snap point by hitting E.

0:23:11.360,0:23:26.560
And we don't have enough wood. That 
is not good. We are really unprepared.

0:23:26.560,0:23:34.640
I heard that snarl in the Oh, we 
broke our hammer. No, our axe.

0:23:36.240,0:23:45.440
We need to eat. Let's do five and a 
six. That'll give us a higher health

0:23:45.440,0:24:03.840
bar. As after we've eaten, you can 
see our health bar start to go up.

0:24:30.800,0:24:33.280
See how much more building we can do.

0:25:02.800,0:25:28.800
this. really about the minimum building 
of a shelter I think you can do.

0:25:32.880,0:25:38.240
Okay, I'm draining my stamina too much.

0:25:38.240,0:25:57.920
Something comes up behind me and attacks 
me. I'm out of stamina means I'm dead.

0:26:16.480,0:26:21.200
You want to know how to build this shelter? Um,

0:26:21.200,0:26:27.200
you can follow this design. Uh, little 
bit more talked about in the first video.

0:26:28.320,0:26:37.440
Let's drop our bed in here. We still need wood. 
It takes 10 wood for a bed. Is that right?

0:26:37.440,0:26:49.360
Eight wood. And we've got seven. So, we just need 
one more. And then we should be able to sleep.

0:26:49.360,0:26:54.480
We're also about to break our club. You 
see that white bar below the club or the

0:26:54.480,0:27:04.800
flashing red bar below the hammer? That means 
the hammer's broken. The club is about to break.

0:27:04.800,0:27:13.440
But it's going to get us through the night.

0:27:13.440,0:27:20.160
Now that means we lost our

0:27:20.160,0:27:23.920
Oh, look at that. There was a house right there.

0:27:23.920,0:27:32.800
Was that the house with the 
bees in it? I don't know.

0:27:32.800,0:27:40.800
All right. Well, that is day two in Valheim.

0:27:40.800,0:27:45.840
And we're going to we're going to 
break our club in this fight. I'm

0:27:45.840,0:27:52.000
almost sure of it. Which means 
we'll have to fight by fist.

0:27:55.680,0:28:04.000
if that happens.

0:28:04.000,0:28:11.920
All right. Real quick, one thing we haven't 
talked about is the workbench. The workbench

0:28:11.920,0:28:18.000
has to have a that's a repair. So, we 
went through and repaired all of our

0:28:18.000,0:28:23.920
items. You can't repair a torch. torches 
burn and when they're all burned out,

0:28:23.920,0:28:31.440
they're gone. But we're able to repair 
repair our hammer, repair our club,

0:28:31.440,0:28:42.480
repair almost all of our items can be repaired. 
We can also craft new items at the workbench.

0:28:42.480,0:28:50.160
Um, so we can make a flint knife. We've 
got two wood, four flint, and two leather.

0:28:50.160,0:28:57.040
These are the materials needed. Would click 
craft. Would have a flint knife. I'm not crazy

0:28:57.040,0:29:03.040
about the flint knife. A lot of people like it. 
It's just not my weapon of choice. I'm going

0:29:03.040,0:29:13.520
to go with the flint axe. I need to grab just a 
little more wood and we'll be ready to do that.

0:29:13.520,0:29:17.360
So, let's craft this.

0:29:21.200,0:29:32.240
and then we'll wrap it up 
for the for this episode.

0:29:32.240,0:29:37.040
We need to talk about building physics 
at some point. It's not really important,

0:29:37.040,0:29:43.680
but it's interesting topic to know 
how things work and uh that. So,

0:29:43.680,0:29:49.200
we can make a rag tunic. We can make rag 
trousers. That's going to give us one more

0:29:49.200,0:29:58.480
piece of armor. Right now, our total armor 
is one. So, let's make those rag trousers.

0:29:58.480,0:30:03.680
And I'm going to put them over here just so 
our armor's all together. I'm going to right

0:30:03.680,0:30:12.960
click it to put them on. Now, we've at least 
doubled our armor. Let's get rid of these guys.

0:30:15.200,0:30:20.400
They don't like the fire. That's why 
they keep running away. We move away

0:30:20.400,0:30:32.640
from that fire and they'll 
probably come attack us.

0:30:32.640,0:30:38.720
All right.

0:30:38.720,0:30:50.960
So, let's make this uh flint axe. That's a nice 
little upgrade for our weapon. So, real quick, a

0:30:50.960,0:30:58.320
little bit about weapons. Let's put this flint axe 
up here and put it side by side with our wood one.

0:30:58.320,0:31:06.000
So, we hover over that and that tells us that it's 
a onehanded. It's crafted by Conrad. Weighs uh one

0:31:06.000,0:31:15.600
and a half stone pounds, whatever your unit is. Uh 
it quality is a one. We'll talk about quality here

0:31:15.600,0:31:25.200
in a minute. Its durability is 100%. Like we saw 
yesterday, it durability goes down as we use it.

0:31:25.200,0:31:33.200
Um and then we can repair it uh if it breaks or we 
can repair it whenever we want. It's repaired at

0:31:33.200,0:31:42.960
a station level of one. So just a basic workbench 
will allow us to repair it. But the real the thing

0:31:42.960,0:31:50.800
that we really want to look at here is the slash. 
It has a maximum of 15 damage on slash. With our

0:31:50.800,0:31:57.600
skill level, we're going to do between five and 
nine points of damage. Now, if we look at the

0:31:57.600,0:32:04.880
flint axe, basically it looks all the same all the 
way down to the slash damage. You notice the flint

0:32:04.880,0:32:11.920
is an upgrade to the stone axe. The flint axe will 
do a maximum of 20 damage. With our skill level,

0:32:11.920,0:32:19.840
that's a 6 to 12. 6 to 12 is a nice little 
improvement over 5 to 9. Close to the same on the

0:32:19.840,0:32:28.960
low end, but that's uh what 30% more on the high 
end. So, we can do a lot more damage. Now, next

0:32:28.960,0:32:35.760
down it says the stamina use. You'll notice we've 
got a stamina use here of six and a stamina use

0:32:35.760,0:32:47.040
here of six. That's the same. That's really nice 
to have that same stamina as we progress and get

0:32:47.040,0:32:56.640
higher level weapons. That may not always be the 
case. The block force and and parry bonus is nice.

0:32:56.640,0:33:03.680
So, we haven't talked about that, but I've been 
clicking a one to swing the axe. I mean, a left

0:33:03.680,0:33:12.880
click on the mouse. A right click on the mouse 
will allow us to block. So, I can block an attack.

0:33:12.880,0:33:20.800
And if I do a good parry block d, you know, timing 
it just right, that will allow us to get the parry

0:33:20.800,0:33:29.760
bonus uh of 2x, meaning the next hit that we 
do, if we do it right away, immediately after

0:33:29.760,0:33:38.640
the attack, it'll do 2x damage. And it generates 
a parry adrenaline of five. That's something that

0:33:38.640,0:33:48.800
we're going to get into later when we can craft 
a trinket. Uh, its knock back is 50. Not sure the

0:33:48.800,0:33:54.640
meaning of that. I'm not going to try to get into 
it now. Its backstab does three times the damage.

0:33:54.640,0:34:02.000
So, backstabs are really handy. We can sneak up 
behind one of these deer. With that 3x damage, we

0:34:02.000,0:34:10.560
may be able to just drop a deer. Anyway, uh we're 
running a little long on this video. Going to try

0:34:10.560,0:34:17.760
to keep them to a day each. There's a lot I wanted 
to talk about. Uh we'll wrap here. I'm Grandpa Bud

0:34:17.760,0:34:24.640
and thank you for joining us in Grandpa Plays 
Valheim Solo. Thank you all. Have a good one.
