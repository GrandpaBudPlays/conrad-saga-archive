A warrior’s victory is won long before the first blow is struck. Conrad spends these final hours in the Meadows honoring the old ways—tending the hearth, taming the wild boars of the field, and meticulously outfitting himself for the trial ahead.

From the careful fletching of arrows to the construction of a tactical sanctuary near the Great Stag’s altar, every action is a prayer for survival. Watch as the preparation meets the storm in a thunderous confrontation with Eikthyr. With the claiming of the Antler Pickaxe, the first chapter of the exile ends, and the stone of the earth will finally yield to our will. Valhalla is watching.

Here is a link to the my favorite storage layout that I mentioned. I admire the attention to detail that PHINQS put into his work. Nothing like the sloppy stuff I do.

I love his Efficient Stone Base. I used his design in one of my worlds and really like his design.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:01.920,0:00:08.960
and uh let's go ahead and get started.

0:00:08.960,0:00:12.640
So, what's is this the end of 
the 10th 11th day? Something

0:00:12.640,0:00:21.280
like that. Find out in the morning. 
I think we're on day 11. So, let's

0:00:21.280,0:00:28.960
um What do we have in the way of feathers? 
Got 27. We could really use more feathers.

0:00:30.480,0:00:40.560
Um, and we need more wood. So, tomorrow morning 
we're going to have to chop trees to get some

0:00:40.560,0:00:49.680
wood. We're going to need 100 200 arrows, maybe 
for the ether fight. And we need another crude

0:00:49.680,0:00:58.080
bow. That's right. We wanted to back up crude bow. 
Not going to try to um upgrade it. We'll just go

0:00:58.080,0:01:05.280
ahead and go with a basic one. It's just a backup 
in case ours breaks. I wonder if we have enough

0:01:05.280,0:01:15.200
materials now to make one. We need 10 wood, eight 
leather scrap. I think we've got enough material.

0:01:16.720,0:01:20.640
Looks like we're still

0:01:20.640,0:01:28.560
I don't know if we're Yeah, I think they're 
both No, one of those. No, they're both

0:01:28.560,0:01:43.840
They're both taming. Uh we probably need to 
drop some more food in there at some point.

0:01:43.840,0:01:47.840
But in the meantime, let's go chop some trees.

0:01:47.840,0:02:05.120
Hopefully that doesn't stop the taming 
and hopefully we stay in range. [sighs]

0:02:05.120,0:02:10.720
Got to remember to eat our food.

0:02:10.720,0:02:13.120
Somebody needs to be reminding me to do that.

0:02:19.120,0:02:24.080
sarcastically. U be really nice if 
the game would remind us that we need

0:02:24.080,0:02:32.480
to eat. Unfortunately, it does and I ignore it.

0:02:32.480,0:02:38.800
It's no wonder I die from no food all the time.

0:03:07.200,0:03:08.800
Missed the parry on that one,

0:03:08.800,0:03:20.000
but we staggered him with our axe blow 
and then we got the bonus that way.

0:03:20.000,0:03:28.400
Going to use these berries to feed the boores.

0:03:28.400,0:03:32.000
We're going to get them excited for a 
minute as we go up there to feed them,

0:03:32.000,0:03:37.120
but I'd like to make sure 
they've got plenty of food.

0:03:40.960,0:03:48.320
See if we can get out of here 
before they get all excited.

0:03:48.320,0:03:53.920
That worked well.

0:03:53.920,0:04:04.640
We've been real fortunate so far. Going to 
get that big oak tree one of these days.

0:04:04.640,0:04:09.680
But we're gonna have to get some um

0:04:09.680,0:04:14.160
copper

0:04:14.160,0:04:29.520
and tin out of the black forest before we can take 
down one of those oak trees or the birch trees.

0:04:29.520,0:04:42.880
You know, if we fall enough of these trees 
against that oak, it'll eventually fall.

0:04:42.880,0:04:51.600
That falling lumber won't hurt us, but if one 
of those logs fall on us, that won't feel good.

0:04:51.600,0:04:57.360
This guy doesn't look to me like he's leaning 
in the right direction to fall on the oak.

0:05:03.680,0:05:10.320
He's going to fall on me if 
I don't get out of the way.

0:05:10.320,0:05:20.720
I heard the right click is a good way to get rid 
of those stumps. Now, later in the Black Forest,

0:05:20.720,0:05:26.960
the uh one of the two trees in the Black Forest, 
the stumps come off real low to the ground.

0:05:26.960,0:05:33.600
So often times it's really hard to get an 
angle to get them out. When that happens,

0:05:33.600,0:05:40.000
that alternate attack is the best way to get them.

0:05:40.000,0:05:51.120
Do that by uh right clicking the mouse 
button, mouse wheel. Not right click,

0:05:51.120,0:05:54.640
just clicking the mouse wheel.

0:05:58.720,0:06:06.080
larger stamina use, but also more damage. 
Not attack method that I've used a lot in

0:06:06.080,0:06:18.800
the past. Maybe something I should give a 
try to. Okay, we've reached maximum weight.

0:06:18.800,0:06:23.120
Let's go put uh convert some of this into arrows.

0:06:25.120,0:06:29.040
and see if we can make that back up crude bow

0:06:29.040,0:06:39.840
[snorts] at the workbench.

0:06:39.840,0:06:47.360
I'm really hoping that we don't need 
that, but now we've got it in case we do.

0:06:47.360,0:06:59.200
And let's grab some of these feathers. We've 
got feathers. We've got wood. We've got

0:06:59.200,0:07:07.440
resin. We might need more resin. Let's 
load up on resin. We're carrying too much,

0:07:07.440,0:07:17.360
but that won't take long to get rid 
of. Okay, let's see what we can do.

0:07:21.600,0:07:26.000
making 20 at a time.

0:07:26.000,0:07:40.640
And that 100 is going to fill us. Uh, but it 
freed up a slot. So, let's just keep going.

0:07:46.640,0:07:52.880
All right, we have

0:07:52.880,0:07:57.200
200

0:07:57.200,0:08:03.760
fire arrows. That's what we will use on ether.

0:08:03.760,0:08:08.000
Got a bunch of stuff in here 
that we want to get rid of.

0:08:09.360,0:08:25.520
could use more room. Probably good idea just to go 
ahead if we got the wood now. Let's drop another

0:08:25.520,0:08:31.680
another chest in here.

0:08:36.560,0:08:41.200
And of course, we need more wood. 
We left some out there. We're not

0:08:41.200,0:08:49.840
going to want to carry much with 
us when we go out on this fight.

0:08:49.840,0:08:59.920
Well, somebody came to join 
the party, it looks like.

0:09:04.080,0:09:16.080
Where did we leave that? We had a log we 
felled right here along the edge. Excess wood.

0:09:16.080,0:09:24.800
Uh let's go ahead and get a couple. 
Let's get another load of lumber.

0:09:48.240,0:09:52.160
All right, that was efficient.

0:10:12.080,0:10:21.520
Oh, the log killed him. He got caught 
in that log roll and it did him in.

0:10:21.520,0:10:34.720
Oh, we're getting all kinds of company today.

0:10:34.720,0:10:49.840
Let's get all that resin we can. We'll need 
it for all the fire arrows we end up making.

0:10:49.840,0:10:50.880
Maybe we should

0:10:53.200,0:10:58.080
Maybe we should go ahead and make up that

0:10:58.080,0:11:05.600
at least one upgrade to that crude bow because 
if ours breaks, we don't want to be stuck with

0:11:05.600,0:11:12.000
a crappy bow. Crude bow is not that 
good to start with, but we might as

0:11:12.000,0:11:18.880
well upgrade it if we can. I think we've 
got plenty of leather scraps for that.

0:11:40.960,0:11:47.040
So, again, this is probably the earliest 
I've considered fighting ether. Usually,

0:11:47.040,0:11:52.640
I have troll armor or bear armor 
by now. I'm [clears throat] falling

0:11:52.640,0:12:01.440
bear armor is falling out of favor with me. Um

0:12:01.440,0:12:09.360
just not

0:12:09.360,0:12:19.120
don't like the um the stats it gives you.

0:12:19.120,0:12:24.000
Personally, I like this in monetary 
value by like that's worth one each.

0:12:24.000,0:12:30.560
This is worth five each. These are worth 
10 each. And these are worth 20 each. So,

0:12:30.560,0:12:35.040
we keep them in order. Let's move 
this over to the food locker. This

0:12:35.040,0:12:42.640
will be our kind of treasure. We got a bee 
here. We can make a hive. We don't need any

0:12:42.640,0:12:51.200
more hives. I think that's plenty. But we 
have it. So, what the heck? Let's use it.

0:13:01.360,0:13:08.960
You know, just for fun, we should make a 
raft here and do a little sailing when when

0:13:08.960,0:13:19.840
we get a chance. Hopefully that's not Oh, the 
boar's been tamed. Look at that. Fantastic.

0:13:21.200,0:13:37.840
That was easy. The bees are sleeping. Well, 
that's too bad. I want to make sure they're happy.

0:13:37.840,0:13:42.000
Are they both tamed or just one of them? 
No, the other one's still taming because

0:13:42.000,0:13:48.720
we see the hearts coming up. But our 
one star is friendly. He's turned green.

0:13:51.360,0:13:56.800
So that green bar means it's 
a friendly and the red bars

0:13:56.800,0:14:02.720
are obviously in an opponent or non-friendly.

0:14:02.720,0:14:09.120
All right, see what we can do 
here for upgrading that bow. Yeah,

0:14:09.120,0:14:18.000
let's organize. We'll take a minute 
organize ouruh inventory a little bit.

0:14:18.000,0:14:24.640
upgrade. We can upgrade the wood 
shield. That wouldn't hurt. We

0:14:24.640,0:14:31.200
got what we need for that. The crude 
bow. We need some deer hide. I think

0:14:31.200,0:14:42.720
we've got deer hide. Maybe we don't. 
[snorts] Maybe we won't upgrade it.

0:14:42.720,0:14:46.400
Let's move this over to the food section.

0:14:48.640,0:14:51.920
Oh, we were going to put a 
chest there. Losing track

0:14:51.920,0:14:58.240
of what I'm doing, aren't I? That's not unusual.

0:14:58.240,0:15:07.520
But this is just casual. We're not 
going to get too serious with this.

0:15:07.520,0:15:13.120
All right, let's divide this up. 
We'll put all of our veggies upstairs,

0:15:13.120,0:15:21.600
all of our meat downstairs. So, let's 
take that that that we can move it

0:15:21.600,0:15:30.800
up here. And then let's organize. Just 
keep these things grouped a little bit.

0:15:30.800,0:15:38.400
That is a vegetable. I suppose it's plant-based.

0:15:38.400,0:15:46.880
And what do we got here? We got treasure. 
And we'll just put miscellaneous up here.

0:15:46.880,0:15:53.680
We'll put all of our crafting materials 
down here. Probably should reverse it

0:15:53.680,0:16:03.760
because this will be a a real pain. We got 
50 wood. I don't need to carry 50 wood,

0:16:03.760,0:16:08.880
especially not into the ether fight. 
We'll take 25. Unlikely we're going

0:16:08.880,0:16:18.160
to need it. Going to dump these other 
arrows over here in our storage closet.

0:16:18.160,0:16:21.200
That's pretty much full up. We're 
not going to need a torch during

0:16:21.200,0:16:35.280
the ether fight. Putting these in order just 
because I'm pay I'm kind of anal that way.

0:16:49.280,0:16:52.640
All right.

0:16:52.640,0:17:00.160
Don't need to carry the hoe into that fight with 
us. There's our backup bow. We'll have it in the

0:17:00.160,0:17:07.120
hot spot so we can flip it. Don't really need 
the hammer, but we'll take it. Um, actually,

0:17:07.120,0:17:12.560
one of the strategies people use, I'm not 
going to try it, but they just drop fires

0:17:12.560,0:17:32.880
down and they fight ether with fire. force 
him to run through these different fires.

0:17:32.880,0:17:42.000
Flint axe. That That'd be a good upgrade. 
But we only have two flint. We need

0:17:42.000,0:17:53.520
six flint. We got a little daylight. The 
water coastline's close. Which one's closest?

0:17:53.520,0:18:01.280
Right here, south of us. Let's 
just go grab some flint and we

0:18:01.280,0:18:12.240
can upgrade the axe. Fighting close 
combat with ether is pretty dangerous

0:18:12.240,0:18:15.600
because of his AoE attacks.

0:18:38.080,0:18:44.800
But even at that, we may take a few swings 
at him, and we don't want that axe to break.

0:18:56.800,0:19:10.880
That blocked with just our hands.

0:19:15.120,0:19:20.000
So if you hold down right click to 
block and then as you move the mouse

0:19:20.000,0:19:30.320
around your character will move 
in that direction. Kind of handy.

0:19:30.320,0:19:40.320
That should be plenty of flint.

0:19:56.240,0:20:02.720
I hear the deer. I hear one 
pretty close, but as usual,

0:20:02.720,0:20:07.360
it's hard to see him through this scrub brush.

0:20:12.160,0:20:16.400
Let's head back home.

0:20:16.400,0:20:20.240
Get our stamina food up there. Gives us See,

0:20:20.240,0:20:30.400
that takes us from a 50 to 
almost 100 stamina. Very useful.

0:20:34.240,0:20:45.760
So, that guy is still taming. Or is is 
he? He's tame. He's tame. All right. Uh,

0:20:45.760,0:20:48.800
at this point, we're going to start 
getting piglets. We probably need to

0:20:48.800,0:20:56.720
tighten up this because the piglets 
can run through pretty small gaps.

0:20:56.720,0:21:12.240
uh something that we'll work on I think 
in the morning. Let's see about ether.

0:21:12.240,0:21:20.080
Let's see uh if we're ready for that.

0:21:20.080,0:21:28.800
Four leather scraps. Told you I'd open that top 
one first time every time. All those leather

0:21:28.800,0:21:39.200
scraps that we uh have been gathering, 
we've used them all up. Almost everyone.

0:21:39.200,0:21:51.760
We're down to 15. We had over 50.

0:21:51.760,0:21:57.840
wanted to come over here and check for 
something. Oh, how many deer trophies do

0:21:57.840,0:22:04.880
we have? We've got 13. I believe it only 
takes three to do the summoning. I hope

0:22:04.880,0:22:15.680
that's right. We're going to drop those up 
here so that we can drop them on the altar.

0:22:18.320,0:22:25.360
I'm going to have to take a short break 
right here and we'll be right back.

0:22:25.360,0:22:33.040
Well, the only other thing is where 
is Ether? He's here. I don't think

0:22:33.040,0:22:43.040
we're going to run all the way back 
there for the fight. But actually,

0:22:43.040,0:22:49.200
let's go take a look at that site in the morning. 
See if that's where we want to fight. Uh,

0:22:49.200,0:22:54.320
I'm worried about being right there on 
the coastline. Kind of want plenty of

0:22:54.320,0:23:03.600
room for freedom of movement, but nothing 
says we can't pull him in more inward.

0:23:03.600,0:23:17.600
All right, here we go. Um, what do we need? We 
need to eat food. We're probably going to have to

0:23:17.600,0:23:24.640
start this on the next second day. We've 
got We've got wood. We don't need this

0:23:24.640,0:23:34.080
flint. We'll want our hammer for sure. Don't 
think we need to take this resin with us.

0:23:36.000,0:23:41.760
I'm going to take this all of this wood.

0:23:41.760,0:23:46.800
We may be gone for a day or two. It's 
going to take a while to get there.

0:23:46.800,0:23:57.520
Then we want to look at the site and 
see if it's um how we how we want it.

0:23:57.520,0:24:02.960
All right, let's head to that upper left corner.

0:24:12.800,0:24:21.040
This is all going to be the meadows. Should 
be pretty safe. Lots of big oak trees around.

0:24:21.040,0:24:32.240
Take advantage of that once we get our 
upgrade upgraded axe. Next tier axe.

0:24:38.640,0:24:48.640
Oh, hi there. Oh, you're one 
star, too. Can I get you? Come on.

0:24:48.640,0:24:54.880
All right. Not going to chase him 
down. Wouldn't work anyway. Doesn't

0:24:54.880,0:25:01.200
for me. I love watching the guys who 
run through the forest and they drop a

0:25:03.200,0:25:08.880
Fire spit in front.

0:25:08.880,0:25:15.520
We got that bee out of there. So, 
don't need to worry about that.

0:25:15.520,0:25:26.160
Looks like we use that for temporary

0:25:41.760,0:25:50.080
Don't know how to run past him and take a shot.

0:26:01.200,0:26:06.080
Now, if we could cut these white 
trees down, these birch trees,

0:26:06.080,0:26:14.160
get some fine wood, we could be using a portal 
rather than having to do all this running.

0:26:14.160,0:26:26.320
Not trying to hunt deer, and I find lots of them. 
They're real hard to find when we're hunting.

0:26:26.320,0:26:39.440
There's a boar. We're running low on 
scraps. Scrap leather, so why not?

0:26:39.440,0:26:46.000
Come here.

0:26:46.000,0:26:47.040
Come to papa.

0:26:49.360,0:26:52.960
Got a beehive right there. Let's 
go ahead and grab the bee. Well,

0:26:52.960,0:27:07.440
we don't need more bees, 
but won't hurt to have them.

0:27:07.440,0:27:14.640
Oh, look at that. The honey and 
the bee fell on the upper floor.

0:27:15.840,0:27:21.040
Going to have to tear it down anyway.

0:27:21.040,0:27:26.960
No, we don't want to use a deer trophy. That's 
supposed to be the hammer. That's those bad habits

0:27:26.960,0:27:35.920
I talked about. You get used to a number and you 
just expect it to behave that way. [groaning] Now,

0:27:35.920,0:27:40.640
I think it's a great habit for your primary 
weapon. You should put it in one spot. Always

0:27:40.640,0:27:52.560
have it there. I haven't decided if I like 
the idea of doing the same for the stuff I

0:27:52.560,0:28:06.400
switch out cuz as the game progresses 
there's different things I want there.

0:28:06.400,0:28:11.520
All right, let's get back to what we were 
doing. We're going to go kill the boss.

0:28:25.200,0:28:35.920
No bees in here, but we didn't empty it. 
That's good. I like getting a few extra.

0:28:35.920,0:28:40.000
Leave the door open. We know we've been there.

0:28:53.120,0:28:59.120
I like that painted shield. I haven't applied 
styles much in the past really. I just kind

0:28:59.120,0:29:07.920
of discovered it recently or remembered to use 
it, I should say. Discovered it a long time ago.

0:29:21.440,0:29:28.560
The arrow didn't kill him, 
but the fire dot finally did.

0:29:32.800,0:29:45.360
Okay, we want to be to the right of this.

0:29:45.360,0:29:51.520
Almost got him.

0:29:51.520,0:29:55.920
There we go.

0:29:55.920,0:30:00.800
Another bad habit of mine. I put my fingers down

0:30:00.800,0:30:15.600
on the keyboard in the wrong place and 
I use the auto run the Q instead of W

0:30:15.600,0:30:24.560
and you let up on the Q and you're still running.

0:30:24.560,0:30:39.680
Okay, we'll take him out and him.

0:30:39.680,0:30:43.680
Don't need to worry about bringing 
a one star back since we have one

0:30:43.680,0:30:51.200
there. We'll eventually breed another 
onear. We'll start harvesting them

0:30:51.200,0:31:00.880
and eventually we will just kill all 
the no stars and have only one stars.

0:31:00.880,0:31:14.320
Missed him. Oh well, here comes the boar.

0:31:14.320,0:31:26.400
All right, let's get there. 
This trip's taking too long

0:31:26.400,0:31:43.920
because I keep doing these side 
trips. And there's another one.

0:31:43.920,0:31:55.680
Oh, they didn't like that. But it didn't break.

0:31:55.680,0:32:04.240
There we go. Let him calm down.

0:32:04.240,0:32:15.600
Lots of bees. I don't know what we're 
going to do with all these bees.

0:32:15.600,0:32:23.120
Miss me. Miss me now. You got to catch me.

0:32:23.120,0:32:28.160
Yeah, I saw those mushrooms go by.

0:32:28.160,0:32:34.640
This trip's taking too long. But I 
remember a bunch of beehives we left

0:32:34.640,0:32:43.600
behind. There's another one. We just 
Do we not that many bees? Queen bees.

0:32:46.640,0:32:54.240
Seldom will we need that much honey. 
I mean, we'll use lots of honey,

0:32:54.240,0:33:03.280
but five beehives is sufficient. Well, not 
going out that way. Let's use the window.

0:33:03.280,0:33:09.280
All right, I give up.

0:33:09.280,0:33:15.200
Uh, not messing with you. Another

0:33:15.200,0:33:18.800
beehive.

0:33:18.800,0:33:24.480
We're not going to be hurting

0:33:24.480,0:33:33.200
for honey.

0:33:33.200,0:33:38.720
Let's go around front. Use the 
door, which isn't even there.

0:33:39.600,0:33:47.440
take everything we can out of 
the chest and let's move on.

0:33:47.440,0:34:01.440
And again, just running past some of this stuff 
because we're wasting too much time getting there.

0:34:01.440,0:34:05.520
Got lots of beehives.

0:34:05.520,0:34:21.120
Don't hear one here. There's Ether. 
So, if we start him here, boy, it is a

0:34:21.120,0:34:28.800
not a terrible fight. If we die, we're going 
to respawn back at the base. And that's a

0:34:28.800,0:34:37.120
long run from here. Let's see if there's 
a a house close by. We've got this one.

0:34:37.120,0:34:47.680
It needs a lot of retrofitting to get it 
back into shape. The velo rest rested buff.

0:34:47.680,0:34:54.320
Uh I thought there was a clearing up here.

0:34:54.320,0:35:04.720
I guess I'm wrong. Looks like just more forest.

0:35:04.720,0:35:08.880
All right, we'll go ahead. We brought 50 
wood with us. We'll go ahead and just uh

0:35:08.880,0:35:20.800
retrofit that old house. If we 
die, we'll be nice and close.

0:35:20.800,0:35:27.840
Any beehives? Any treasure chests?

0:35:27.840,0:35:33.040
Nope. At best, that's going to be spare lumber.

0:35:41.920,0:36:01.520
All right, let's retrofit this. Put a bed 
in it and clean out some of the shrubbery.

0:36:01.520,0:36:01.680
[snorts]

0:36:01.680,0:36:12.080
drop a fire down and we'll have um a good place 
to respawn should the fight not go our way. And

0:36:12.080,0:36:17.200
guess what? We left the hope because we didn't 
think we were going to need it. And I'd love

0:36:17.200,0:36:30.640
to level this ground out. Not needed. We'll just 
uh get by without it. Let's drop our workbench.

0:36:31.760,0:36:52.240
and go to work on this house. 
Let's start with repairs.

0:36:52.240,0:37:00.080
Let's drop our fire right outside here.

0:37:02.960,0:37:10.000
One drawback about this is it is so close that 
Eekther may head our way just as soon as we

0:37:10.000,0:37:23.760
die. Won't give us much of a chance to catch our 
breath. Not terrible. I think we can deal with it,

0:37:23.760,0:37:28.720
but probably not how I would plan 
for it if I was planning ahead.

0:38:14.720,0:38:24.080
Uh, the spacing isn't quite right 
here. I'm not sure what I did wrong.

0:38:24.080,0:38:29.680
Somewhere we messed up. I 
think it was right there.

0:38:29.680,0:38:40.240
Uh, can we Yes. Get that wood off the 
roof. And now let's try this again.

0:38:40.240,0:38:45.200
There's that one. And that one. That looks good.

0:38:45.200,0:38:59.280
Let's go ahead and finish it off properly. 
Put that X right there. Come on. There we go.

0:38:59.280,0:39:10.480
Now we're getting our rested buff. Let's drop a 
bed down here so that we can set our spawn point.

0:39:10.480,0:39:21.440
bad. Even though we've got this ugly 
floor. Well, wait a minute. Can we

0:39:21.440,0:39:27.120
What do we need for a hoe? We need 
five more wood and two one more

0:39:27.120,0:39:32.480
stone. I think we can manage that. 
We're not going to start this fight

0:39:32.480,0:39:39.680
at this point in the day. We want to 
start it first thing in the morning.

0:39:39.680,0:39:59.840
So, we just need Oh, yeah. This is 
really close. That may be too close.

0:39:59.840,0:40:07.200
Ether is definitely going to seek us out 
just as soon as we die and respawn. But,

0:40:07.200,0:40:16.880
we haven't we haven't died yet. So that is be a 
new experience when you die. Um, all your stuff

0:40:16.880,0:40:22.880
drops and it drops a tombstone where it next 
to your body and then all your stuff is in that

0:40:22.880,0:40:32.080
tombstone. I call it a tombstone. It's a marker of 
some kind. Doesn't really look like a tombstone.

0:40:32.080,0:40:38.160
Um,

0:40:38.160,0:40:43.280
and you have to run back and get your stuff. So,

0:40:43.280,0:40:47.360
when we die and we show up back 
here and then ek their heads for us,

0:40:47.360,0:40:57.360
we're not going to have any weapons with us. 
All right. Where'd that hoe? There's the hoe.

0:41:00.960,0:41:09.200
I don't mind a dirt floor, but I don't like 
it when the grass is showing through my bed.

0:41:09.200,0:41:19.840
Let's go ahead and put down a rug 
to get a little more comfort level.

0:41:19.840,0:41:26.240
And there's must be somebody nearby 
cuz we're not resting. Here he is.

0:42:03.200,0:42:06.240
We've got what do we got? Three stone on us.

0:42:06.240,0:42:16.240
We got just a little bit of daylight. 
There a few more stone laying around.

0:42:24.880,0:42:39.280
One more stone. Come on.

0:43:00.320,0:43:08.800
Is that five? All right, I'm going to 
drop another fire down here. So if we

0:43:08.800,0:43:22.480
die and Eekler comes for us, he'll at 
least have to deal with these fires.

0:43:22.480,0:43:32.000
As long as it's not raining tomorrow morning. 
Okay, now we've got this chest here. I'm going

0:43:32.000,0:43:37.360
to put half of our food in here so that 
if we die, we can grab something to eat.

0:43:41.360,0:43:46.800
And then we're going to eat 
first thing in the morning. Uh,

0:43:46.800,0:43:58.560
no need to carry this stuff with us. Doesn't hurt 
to carry it, but when we go to pick up our stuff,

0:43:58.560,0:44:04.720
it's just less to pick up. Shouldn't matter. 
If you die and you go pick up your stuff,

0:44:04.720,0:44:11.440
it's going to all slot back as much as 
it can to right where it was. Tomorrow

0:44:11.440,0:44:22.320
morning, [clears throat] we start the fight. 
This house makes me nervous. It's too close, but

0:44:22.320,0:44:29.600
that's just uh going to make 
it a little more exciting.

0:44:29.600,0:44:31.600
Okay, let's eat up.

0:44:37.200,0:44:41.680
and let's go start that. So,

0:44:41.680,0:44:47.440
we're going to basically be doing lots and 
lots of arrows. When he first shows up,

0:44:47.440,0:44:58.720
we're going to start out with our axe. Get rid 
of this guy. We don't want him hanging around

0:44:58.720,0:45:06.640
and interrupting the fight. just get in the way.

0:45:06.640,0:45:17.680
I get rid of some of this scrub brush, too.

0:45:17.680,0:45:27.600
Want some clear lines of 
sight when we fight ether.

0:45:27.600,0:45:36.800
We're just going to take a couple minutes 
to do this. before we start the fight.

0:45:36.800,0:45:39.680
If we're lucky, Ether might break some of this

0:45:39.680,0:45:48.800
fine wood for us out of these birch 
trees. There's plenty of them around.

0:45:48.800,0:45:57.120
And I have no doubt that he 
will break at least one tree.

0:45:57.120,0:46:10.000
I should say fell the tree. I don't know 
that he'll actually break it into lumber.

0:46:10.000,0:46:12.880
So, the reason we're doing this is 
we're going to be doing a lot of

0:46:12.880,0:46:18.480
arrow shots. We want as much space 
as we can between ether and us,

0:46:18.480,0:46:26.640
and we want to be around without tripping all 
the time over like a fallen log. Something like

0:46:26.640,0:46:42.240
that. Could have done some of this 
yesterday. Might have been smarter.

0:46:42.240,0:46:47.520
So, we'll be running and dodging

0:46:47.520,0:46:52.480
and we just want to be able to see where we're 
going, where Ether is, how to get a clean shot

0:46:52.480,0:47:05.440
on him. Wouldn't mind getting rid of those 
boulders, but we don't have the tool for it.

0:47:05.440,0:47:14.000
The the other ether location probably a 
better idea. Just this is not the best

0:47:14.000,0:47:20.480
layout for us, but we're 
going to see what happens.

0:47:25.040,0:47:30.720
In case you're wondering, you you see those 
birds on the ground? Yes, you can shoot them.

0:47:30.720,0:47:38.560
They will drop uh two to three feathers each. So, 
we're overweight. You see all that sweat dropping

0:47:38.560,0:47:44.240
off of us. And you see we're losing stamina 
quickly as we try to make our way to the house.

0:47:44.800,0:47:53.040
Thought maybe I could get there 
and drop off some of this wood.

0:47:53.040,0:47:57.360
Uh, doesn't look like that's going to 
happen. But no, I don't want a deer

0:47:57.360,0:48:09.040
trophy. I want my hammer. Let's 
just drop a couple bundles here.

0:48:09.040,0:48:13.120
And uh, I think we're good to go.

0:48:18.720,0:48:24.960
You ready for the boss fight? I don't know if 
I a fish. We can't do anything with that. Yeah.

0:48:24.960,0:48:32.400
What happens is he washes up on shore during 
a storm. And we won't be able to to cut that

0:48:32.400,0:48:41.680
fish up into raw fish and cook it until we 
get an upgraded cooking station. Maybe even

0:48:41.680,0:48:52.400
a couple of upgrades from now. All right, this 
is it. Here we go. Let's get out our axe. Wait,

0:48:52.400,0:49:00.400
not going to sacrifice my axe. I just want it 
out. Got my shield. When Ether starts to form,

0:49:00.400,0:49:05.680
we'll see a bunch of uh dots in the 
general direction of where he's going

0:49:05.680,0:49:10.240
to come to life. We're going to head 
for that, unless it's out in the water.

0:49:13.280,0:49:18.240
get this fight started.

0:49:18.240,0:49:27.600
Uh, where is he? Over here.

0:49:27.600,0:49:34.160
There he is. Get a couple hits in. 
Get out of the way. Switch to our

0:49:34.160,0:49:48.960
bow. And looks like a reindeer. 
Santa Claus is coming to town.

0:49:48.960,0:49:57.200
See if we can uh use that for cover.

0:49:57.200,0:50:04.320
That's that AoE. We want to stay away from it.

0:50:04.320,0:50:15.840
Ouch. took a good part of our health down there.

0:50:15.840,0:50:23.040
This is why we wanted a clear area to fight in.

0:50:23.040,0:50:31.440
Keep an eye on those health points.

0:50:31.440,0:50:41.840
Let our stamina drain. That's not 
good. Got an ad with a grrey lane.

0:50:41.840,0:50:49.520
Here he comes. Ouch.

0:50:49.520,0:50:54.880
He's having some pathing issues.

0:50:54.880,0:51:01.120
And we can use that to our advantage.

0:51:01.120,0:51:16.720
That's why we clear it out. We don't 
like this. No, no clear line of sight.

0:51:16.720,0:51:27.280
Stay away from those lightning bolts.

0:51:27.280,0:51:30.480
Ouch.

0:51:45.920,0:51:55.200
Got us again. Drained all of our stamina.

0:52:00.800,0:52:03.280
could have used a I don't know. It's a real

0:52:03.280,0:52:23.280
trade-off between stamina 
food and and health food.

0:52:36.000,0:52:46.480
Out of stamina.

0:52:46.480,0:52:50.720
Recover some of the stamina. Let 
him figure out where he's headed.

0:52:51.600,0:52:59.120
We're doing okay so far. Could 
use a little more health, but

0:52:59.120,0:53:06.400
he's got those pathing issues.

0:53:06.400,0:53:18.080
Here he comes.

0:53:21.920,0:53:35.680
I'm out of stamina, so it's getting hard to 
run. I'm half tempted to try to melee him.

0:53:35.680,0:53:45.920
There we go. And that is the first boss fight. 
Good work, Ether. You were honorable fights.

0:53:47.120,0:53:55.520
very very honorable fight.

0:53:55.520,0:54:00.880
And it tells us that we want to return to the 
sacrificial stones. That's those big monoliths

0:54:00.880,0:54:06.800
that we saw at the beginning. Talk a little 
bit about that when we get there. Thank you,

0:54:06.800,0:54:12.720
Hugan. Let's uh update our rested buff.

0:54:14.640,0:54:24.560
Lots of uh fallen trees and lumber around here.

0:54:24.560,0:54:32.080
Going to leave all that here. So, out of the 
fight, we've got the hard antlers and that's

0:54:32.080,0:54:36.640
what's going to allow us to progress into the 
black forest. We're going to take these and

0:54:36.640,0:54:43.840
we're going to make a pickaxe out of them. 
And we've got the eekther trophy. This we're

0:54:43.840,0:54:50.400
going to return to the sacrificial stones. 
Uh looks like we had plenty of arrows for

0:54:50.400,0:54:58.720
the fight. Never hurts to be prepared. All 
right, we got our bonus rested bonus. We're

0:54:58.720,0:55:05.760
going to head all the way back here to where 
we first started when we started the game.

0:55:07.200,0:55:16.720
Um eventually when we have finewood 
and enough eyes, grey dwarf eyes,

0:55:16.720,0:55:28.640
going to drop a portal there so we can 
portal back whenever we want. All right,

0:55:28.640,0:55:34.240
12 lumber. What? What did we pick 
up? I thought we would have grabbed

0:55:34.240,0:55:43.520
a bunch of this fallen lumber as we were 
running around, but I guess we didn't.

0:55:43.520,0:55:50.640
Let's just do a little quick cleanup of the site

0:55:50.640,0:56:02.080
and let's [music] eat.

0:56:09.840,0:56:17.200
And that really concludes everything 
that we needed to do. Well, except for

0:56:17.200,0:56:24.480
this returning to the sacrificial stones. We 
met all our goals for the meadows. Once we

0:56:24.480,0:56:31.360
uh do this final thing, we're going to 
start heading back to the Black Forest.

0:56:39.200,0:56:50.080
So, we finished our first biome with, if I 
remember right, no deaths. That's That's uh better

0:56:50.080,0:57:00.720
than I can say I did the first time. All right. 
What do you think about that general direction?

0:57:01.520,0:57:06.160
Going to try to do this and not stop 
for everything that I see. You know me,

0:57:06.160,0:57:12.480
I get distracted. I can't promise I won't.

0:57:12.480,0:57:23.200
Pardon me. My throat is cold. Still going on.

0:57:30.160,0:57:38.200
Where's that chest?

0:57:38.200,0:57:45.600
[snorts]

0:57:45.600,0:57:51.520
About that direction, I believe. What was 
the marker we put on the map right there?

0:57:51.520,0:58:00.000
Oh, that's one of those abandoned 
villages. We had plenty of those.

0:58:00.000,0:58:13.280
And yeah, we still need deer meat. We still 
need deer hide. I'm just ignoring them for now.

0:58:13.280,0:58:20.960
So, it does concern me the black forest 
that we found. Oh, I got another bee.

0:58:20.960,0:58:31.280
So, I will stop for that cuz 
that's a valuable resource.

0:58:31.280,0:58:35.840
Think there's a chest up there. I kind 
of doubt it. Oh, but the queen bee's

0:58:35.840,0:58:43.440
up there. I would have run off and 
left it and didn't even look. Okay,

0:58:43.440,0:58:50.000
let's keep going north. Looks like 
we're want to go a little northwest.

0:58:51.760,0:59:10.320
Lots of raspberries. Could use those, but 
I really want to try to get through here

0:59:10.320,0:59:17.280
because as you can see, I managed 
to stop for too many distractions.

0:59:22.080,0:59:32.320
Thought I saw a lower stone, but just a stone.

0:59:32.320,0:59:40.000
Did I finish? I am concerned that we've only 
found that one black forest that may not be

0:59:40.000,0:59:48.720
large enough for us uh to find everything 
we need. We're going to need a couple more

0:59:48.720,0:59:56.480
of those burial chambers. We're going to 
need to find some copper deposits. Um,

0:59:56.480,1:00:06.080
tin is usually pretty easy to come by. I've 
never had a problem finding enough tin,

1:00:06.080,1:00:15.520
but okay. Little little off track. Let's 
just head pretty much do west east. Do east.

1:00:23.520,1:00:28.320
Hey, a little treasure.

1:00:28.320,1:00:42.400
Every once in a while those uh burial 
stones, crypts, whatever they are.

1:00:42.400,1:00:44.960
So once we do this, we're going 
to get something that's going

1:00:44.960,1:00:50.480
to help us make that trip home a little easier.

1:00:50.480,1:00:57.840
Boy, this looks like it should 
have been it, but it's not.

1:00:57.840,1:01:03.360
I think that's it.

1:01:03.360,1:01:08.160
Okay, this is where we first got dropped 
into the world. We didn't spend much time

1:01:08.160,1:01:16.880
looking around here, but what we see here, 
see that shows us where he is. I think we

1:01:16.880,1:01:25.280
did that the first time we were here, 
and we were surprised he was so close.

1:01:25.280,1:01:31.120
So, this tells us a little bit about Ether.

1:01:31.120,1:01:39.680
And uh what we want to do, 
we want to take that trophy.

1:01:39.680,1:01:45.520
Let's put it up here in number eight. 
And we want to hang it right here.

1:01:45.520,1:01:53.360
[snorts] The grace of the mighty stag.

1:01:53.360,1:01:59.840
So let's hit E to activate that power.

1:02:06.560,1:02:10.560
And now you notice down here in 
the right hand corner we have

1:02:10.560,1:02:22.160
that ether ready. That is our forsaken 
power. See what Hugan says about this.

1:02:22.160,1:02:26.720
You have been granted the power 
of ether. Use it in times of need.

1:02:27.360,1:02:32.720
Your next target dwells in the Black Forest.

1:02:32.720,1:02:39.120
The Elder awaits. The Elder is the uh Thank 
you, Hugan. The Elder is the boss of the

1:02:39.120,1:02:46.800
Black Forest. We found that marker that tells 
us where he is. So, we're that much ahead. Um,

1:02:46.800,1:02:54.400
but we're going to have to probably take a boat 
to get there. So, the power of ether is going to

1:02:54.400,1:03:02.480
grant us these stats that we see down here. Run 
stamina usage is 60% less. Jump stamina usage 60%

1:03:02.480,1:03:10.800
less. Swim 60% less. And it lasts for 5 minutes. 
And we activate that by pressing the F key. And

1:03:10.800,1:03:21.360
as we complete each boss, we will put their trophy 
on their monolith. The next one up is the elder.

1:03:21.360,1:03:39.360
This gives you an idea how tall of the elder is. 
Um, he's a big and then there's bone mass and

1:03:39.360,1:03:44.960
don't give you the names here. So, I'll save those 
names for later. I'm not going to go through each

1:03:44.960,1:03:55.360
one of them. Sorry for the spoiler there. 
Well, I wish I knew where we made that first

1:03:55.360,1:04:09.840
minor shelter because we could use it right 
now. I thought it was right around here.

1:04:09.840,1:04:16.160
Well, for now, let's do the power 
of ether. I'm going to press F.

1:04:18.240,1:04:26.560
And now we can run a lot further because 
that 60% less stamina usage. I'm going

1:04:26.560,1:04:31.680
to run along the shore though and see if 
I can find that first shelter or one of

1:04:31.680,1:04:43.760
those shelters that we created. Oh, get out 
of the way. We're just trying to go home.

1:04:43.760,1:04:55.840
So, we're going to get back to the house, get 
back home, and we will stop uh there and end

1:04:55.840,1:05:06.880
this recording. And then the next recording, 
we'll head back into the Black Forest again.

1:05:06.880,1:05:12.160
So, we get our with the power of 
ether, we get our stamina back quicker.

1:05:25.120,1:05:31.920
and we get to run for a lot longer.

1:05:31.920,1:05:39.760
Now that we've beaten the boss of the first 
biome, I believe the things at night get a

1:05:39.760,1:05:51.600
little bit more dangerous. We're going to keep 
going and hope that we don't encounter anything.

1:05:51.600,1:06:00.560
See, we got a grey dwarf here in the middle 
of the meadows. We never saw that [snorts]

1:06:00.560,1:06:04.800
until

1:06:04.800,1:06:11.600
we beat the boss. Either that or we're No, 
we're not near that little spot of black. Well,

1:06:11.600,1:06:21.120
there's the black forest, so we're close. And 
uh we're going in. Oh, so we've got a black

1:06:21.120,1:06:27.600
forest over here that we And we got a black 
forest over here. We're following the wrong

1:06:27.600,1:06:35.280
coastline. I thought we were following this 
one. Headed in the wrong direction altogether.

1:06:38.480,1:06:53.280
Didn't we have shelter in this clearing? Oh, 
plenty of neck. All right, let's deal with them.

1:06:53.280,1:06:57.760
Well, that was a slaughter.

1:06:57.760,1:07:02.960
Neck trophy. We don't have 
room for no more rested bonus.

1:07:04.080,1:07:13.120
This is one we tore down. Too bad we could 
use it about now. Let's keep running. We

1:07:13.120,1:07:21.360
got two more minutes left on our our thing. 
Let's head this way. Maybe we'll get to that

1:07:21.360,1:07:30.000
at worst. We'll get to that temporary 
housing we made to fight ether from.

1:07:47.760,1:07:57.120
Big hill.

1:07:57.120,1:08:18.400
Oh, that's the black forest 
again. Don't want to go in there.

1:08:18.400,1:08:23.760
Any of these are temporary. There's a 
temporary housing. And there's a bee.

1:08:23.760,1:08:32.640
We'll get that in the morning. Let's uh 
this is where we cooked our first food

1:08:32.640,1:08:36.800
memories.

1:08:36.800,1:08:42.280
All right.

1:08:42.280,1:08:47.680
[snorts]

1:08:47.680,1:08:56.160
I think our ether power is 
worn off now. Yeah. 24 seconds.

1:08:56.160,1:09:05.280
Which direction do we need to go? Need to 
go down towards that southwest corner. So,

1:09:05.280,1:09:12.160
let's just head in this general direction.

1:09:12.160,1:09:19.360
We should uh we should repair before we 
head out. We should also go ahead and get

1:09:19.360,1:09:31.040
that bee again. We got more than enough 
bees. We're going to have lots of honey,

1:09:31.040,1:09:42.000
but just seems a waste not to take the resource.

1:09:42.000,1:09:49.600
All right, so we're shooting fire arrows. If 
we right click on these flint head arrows,

1:09:49.600,1:09:54.080
we'll use them instead. I want 
to save those fire arrows.

1:09:56.000,1:10:00.080
for a time that we really need him. All right,

1:10:00.080,1:10:08.800
jump over here. Can I get 
that guy off the roof? Yes.

1:10:08.800,1:10:18.720
So, I think we're set. Jump out of there. Anything 
fall behind? Anything on the roof? All right,

1:10:18.720,1:10:23.280
let's get out of here. So, you see 
Ether's got a timer down below it.

1:10:24.800,1:10:36.800
says 1351 1350 1349. That's how long it 
is before we can reuse the ether power.

1:10:36.800,1:10:43.200
So, as we run through here, we're going to 
discover some new land. I wouldn't I wouldn't mind

1:10:43.200,1:10:52.320
looking at this uh clearing over here. A little 
out of our way, but Oh, we've been here before.

1:10:54.240,1:11:01.520
This is where that village was. All 
right, let's keep going this way.

1:11:01.520,1:11:20.480
New lower stone now.

1:11:20.480,1:11:21.520
All right.

1:11:25.520,1:11:31.200
I think our inventory is just about 
full. We could pick up a few stones

1:11:31.200,1:11:36.400
if we see them along the way just so that 
we have five in case we need to make a

1:11:36.400,1:11:43.680
fire. Another village. This one's 
new. We haven't been here before.

1:11:43.680,1:11:49.280
All right, I hear you. Oh, 
you got trapped in the house.

1:11:53.440,1:12:02.080
Don't see any bees in there.

1:12:02.080,1:12:05.840
So, we'll take the treasure. 
We'll get out. Don't need that

1:12:05.840,1:12:14.240
torch. Not too worried about it. Beehive in here.

1:12:14.240,1:12:17.040
I don't see one.

1:12:20.560,1:12:28.240
Oh, we want those. What don't we want?

1:12:28.240,1:12:32.480
Think I'm going to go ahead and 
get rid of the rocks even though.

1:12:32.480,1:12:41.760
And I'm going to trade our torch out 
for one that's not been used at all.

1:12:41.760,1:12:57.440
No bees. Uh, but no treasure, no 
chest either. Southwest this way.

1:12:57.440,1:13:05.360
Yeah, we can always use mushrooms.

1:13:05.360,1:13:15.040
Black forest. That's good to know. Not 
going in there right now. going to Oh,

1:13:15.040,1:13:22.480
this is usually in the black forest and 
it's usually surrounded by grey dwarfs,

1:13:22.480,1:13:35.280
but you'll find a lot of these 
little abandoned structures.

1:13:35.280,1:13:41.280
That's good. I'm glad we encountered 
this. That's the third black forest

1:13:41.280,1:13:46.560
because I was beginning to worry that there 
weren't enough black forest on our island,

1:13:46.560,1:13:56.480
our island, our continent. I 
don't know what to call it.

1:13:56.480,1:14:03.360
Don't see anything there other than we got some

1:14:08.960,1:14:13.120
mushrooms. That's what I was trying to say. I was

1:14:13.120,1:14:21.760
wondering about the black forest and 
whether it was going to be a problem.

1:14:21.760,1:14:28.080
And I'm really really glad to see that 
we have more more black forest because

1:14:28.080,1:14:35.520
we don't want to run out of resources 
and have to go sailing. Actually,

1:14:35.520,1:14:43.600
we do want to go sailing. It's a really good part 
of the game and u essential part of the game,

1:14:43.600,1:14:57.360
but it can be time consuming. spend couple of 
days at sea trying to find the right place. Okay,

1:14:57.360,1:15:01.520
so we went a long way to build our 
base when we could have built it a

1:15:01.520,1:15:07.200
lot closer to the start. We're going 
to stop up here. This is where we

1:15:07.200,1:15:12.000
getting close to where we fought 
Ether. We're going to stop there

1:15:12.000,1:15:20.400
and renew our rested buff because we're 
getting down to our last five minutes.

1:15:20.400,1:15:25.760
Another 8 n minutes before we can uh redo. Oh,

1:15:25.760,1:15:34.400
we dropped that. And there's a lot of stuff 
in our chest that we'd like to take with us

1:15:34.400,1:15:39.600
and we're not going to be able to carry it all.

1:15:39.600,1:15:46.560
Uh uh get all that cooked food that we can.

1:15:46.560,1:15:49.920
Can't decide on the deer trophies. 
We're going to want some of those for

1:15:49.920,1:15:57.200
the stag breaker, which we're able to make now.

1:15:57.200,1:16:04.000
Uh we want the deer skin. What What don't we want?

1:16:04.000,1:16:08.240
I would rather leave behind 
wood that's easy to come by.

1:16:09.760,1:16:18.080
I'd like to keep the flint, but we 
only have one bone. Maybe we'll just

1:16:18.080,1:16:26.720
come back here and pick this up someday. 
I'd rather have deer meat than neck meat.

1:16:26.720,1:16:33.600
One gray dwarf eye. That's replaceable. We'll 
We're going to get a lot of gray dwarf eyes. like

1:16:33.600,1:16:44.400
to keep all this stuff, but we've got to make some 
sacrifice. Okay, we renewed. We got 12 minutes.

1:16:44.400,1:16:50.080
We are

1:16:50.080,1:16:58.560
close to the home base.

1:16:58.560,1:17:02.160
I'm wondering if this connects. 
I think that's all water.

1:17:04.240,1:17:10.880
I just don't know for sure.

1:17:10.880,1:17:19.520
Let's see. Let's walk out here.

1:17:19.520,1:17:25.760
That may go around. Let's go find out.

1:17:25.760,1:17:30.080
I'll need to eat

1:17:30.080,1:17:31.600
and we'll leave you behind.

1:17:48.320,1:17:56.080
All right.

1:17:56.080,1:17:59.600
And we don't have room for neckmate.

1:18:07.920,1:18:15.680
All right. So, if we continue this way, we can 
get around. We're going to have to run through

1:18:15.680,1:18:24.480
the gray through the black forest past that gray 
dwarf spawner, which we could do, but I'd like to

1:18:24.480,1:18:34.560
get home and wrap up this video. We're not going 
that way. We're going to take the easy route.

1:18:34.560,1:18:47.520
Six minutes. We can reuse our ether 
power and that'll speed up our trip.

1:18:47.520,1:18:50.480
So, this was pretty successful journey.

1:18:51.680,1:19:02.160
um prepared the area around Ether. 
Got a temporary housing location,

1:19:02.160,1:19:14.640
had the Eekther fight, and now we'll 
start working on the uh Black Forest.

1:19:14.640,1:19:22.240
You know what we could do once we 
get enough materials is we'll put a

1:19:22.240,1:19:37.680
u portal at one of these temporary places 
so that we can come back here. Hey big guy.

1:19:37.680,1:19:43.920
Oh you two go away. I just want the mushrooms.

1:19:43.920,1:19:54.880
Got Mal's defeat at home.

1:19:54.880,1:20:10.960
I'm going to assume we checked that 
for treasure. We've been buying enough.

1:20:10.960,1:20:13.120
Same with this one. The doors open.

1:20:13.120,1:20:29.760
It's a good indication that we came, 
opened the door, and left it that way.

1:20:29.760,1:20:35.920
By the way, you can scroll the mouse wheel 
in and out to change how close you are to the

1:20:35.920,1:20:42.000
character. When you're in working through the 
forest, it's nice to be pretty close because

1:20:44.240,1:20:51.440
The scrub brush makes it hard to see.

1:20:51.440,1:20:54.880
Whatever your personal preference is,

1:20:54.880,1:21:05.200
but scrolling the mouse wheel 
will move you in and out.

1:21:05.200,1:21:09.520
Three more minutes for ether power.

1:21:13.040,1:21:18.000
Which way do we want to go?

1:21:18.000,1:21:28.320
I think we want this way. Yeah,

1:21:28.320,1:21:37.440
you can follow me all the way home if you want.

1:21:49.320,1:21:50.320
[snorts]

1:21:50.320,1:21:55.680
So, first thing we'll do, we'll explore 
that black forest that's closest to where

1:21:55.680,1:22:04.240
we created our home base. And then if we need 
to, we can come back to where we fought ether

1:22:04.240,1:22:13.200
and explore the black forest that's close 
to there. It's good that we got options.

1:22:13.200,1:22:20.480
Um cuz we may need additional resources 
depending on how big that one is. We

1:22:20.480,1:22:27.440
just don't we won't know till we start 
exploring it and see the extent of the land.

1:22:35.600,1:22:45.760
again. We'll use these. We'll 
use these. Uh Oh, hi there.

1:22:45.760,1:22:53.760
snuck up behind me. Where? 
Oh, we must be close to that

1:22:53.760,1:23:04.560
arena. What do they call that? I think it's 
an arena. Should have marked it on the map.

1:23:04.560,1:23:08.080
Really should have marked that on the map. Y. So,

1:23:08.080,1:23:23.680
here we go. But we'll use mushrooms for higher 
tier recipes. Uh not just uh raw mushrooms.

1:23:28.240,1:23:35.200
I hear you, but we're not stopping. 44 
seconds. We can use the ether power again,

1:23:35.200,1:23:43.120
but we're not going to need it. We're there. 
5 minutes left on our rested bus buff. Hi,

1:23:43.120,1:23:51.920
piggies. Do you guys need more food? I'll 
bet you do. Well, I picked some up for

1:23:51.920,1:24:04.240
you while we were out. My grandson will 
not let me kill the boores when we play.

1:24:04.240,1:24:10.560
He likes the pigs. He's a Minecraft fan

1:24:10.560,1:24:15.680
and his pigs are the favorite thing.

1:24:15.680,1:24:18.720
Three more beehives. Do we really want that?

1:24:20.480,1:24:33.280
We're going to need some lumber if we do. 
All right, let's put away the stuff we got.

1:24:33.280,1:24:41.280
Kind of like to have this organized by meat 
type. Gotten getting a lot of deer meat.

1:24:41.280,1:24:52.320
That's good. We'll use it. Got quite a few uh 
mushrooms, too. Our meat storage is full. So,

1:24:52.320,1:25:02.320
I'm going to put the fish up here and just 
got to make do the best we can. We will be

1:25:02.320,1:25:08.240
using lots of storage. There's lots of great 
storage ideas on the internet. I've seen some

1:25:08.240,1:25:15.600
um really fancy nice looking storage 
cabinet housing combinations.

1:25:16.400,1:25:22.160
uh encourage you to check them out. Maybe I'll 
try to link one in the description for you. I

1:25:22.160,1:25:29.920
looked for that house that I was going to talk 
about. Uh one thing before we wrap this up, let's

1:25:29.920,1:25:40.080
grab some of that wood. I think we left a stack 
of wood outside. We took it with us, didn't we?

1:25:40.080,1:25:43.280
Let's get some wood.

1:25:52.320,1:26:02.640
And let's make that pickaxe. I want to show 
you that before we wrap this video up. And then

1:26:02.640,1:26:09.600
and then we'll call it at 
the end of the day today.

1:26:14.560,1:26:25.760
I like that. I think that um mouse wheel 
attack is a good way to go about it.

1:26:29.200,1:26:37.120
That extra damage that you do

1:26:37.120,1:26:50.160
seems to take make the job shorter. 
Also uses more stamina, but

1:26:50.160,1:26:54.160
curious. What do we

1:26:54.160,1:27:06.000
all right? And we got some 
arrows there. Add a dark trophy.

1:27:06.000,1:27:12.480
Yeah.

1:27:12.480,1:27:23.200
So, we'll come over here and the antler pickaxe. 
That's the tool that we need for getting our

1:27:23.200,1:27:28.880
resources out of the Black Forest. When we 
went into Black Forest in that previous video,

1:27:28.880,1:27:39.920
we saw those tin deposits along the water's 
edge. Um, can we upgrade that pickaxe?

1:27:39.920,1:27:53.840
That's one thing is you want that pickaxe 
upgraded cuz we can't. later pickaxes we can.

1:27:53.840,1:27:58.800
We've got a hoe that's already upgraded.

1:27:58.800,1:28:09.920
There it is. Hugan wants to 
tell us uh about the pickaxe.

1:28:09.920,1:28:14.560
Find copper in the ground lining 
and tin lining the ocean shore.

1:28:15.120,1:28:22.880
So, next video, that's what we're 
going to be doing. Real quick,

1:28:22.880,1:28:36.880
we're going to grab our honey. Reached 
the maximum of four by now. I'm sure

1:28:36.880,1:28:41.680
we've got plenty of bees. I'm not 
sure what I want to do about that.

1:28:42.240,1:28:48.400
I don't think I need more beehives.

1:28:48.400,1:28:53.840
Maybe we'll just put them 
in storage for now. Anyway,

1:28:53.840,1:28:58.640
I'm Grandpa Bud. Thanks for joining 
us. We've been playing Valheim. Been

1:28:58.640,1:29:05.760
a lot of fun. Thanks a lot and we will 
see you all later. Have a good one.
