## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
The peace of the Meadows is shattered. No sooner does Conrad claim the Antler Pickaxe than the Black Forest sends its first true challenge. In this chronicle, we face a brutal raid that leaves the homestead in mourning and sends us into the shadows to claim the tin and copper needed for the Bronze Age.

It is a day of blood and loss. From the first 'Forest is Moving' event to kiting Trolls through the birch trees, an old warrior learns that the Norns spin a dark thread for those who seek to master the wild. Valhalla is watching the smoke rise from the hearth.

0:00:03.200,0:00:11.760
Hey y'all. Back here with Grandpa Bud 
playing Valheim. Gonna look at getting

0:00:11.760,0:00:22.480
Conrad here into the Black Forest. As I 
said previously, I'm not a professional

0:00:22.480,0:00:30.160
at this live streaming. I have really bad 
speech patterns. I pause in the middle and

0:00:30.160,0:00:38.800
say uh too much. But I'm just doing this for 
fun. It's not being monetized. I doubt that

0:00:38.800,0:00:50.400
I will ever try to become professional at this. 
It's a lot of work and I just want to have fun.

0:00:51.600,0:00:59.200
All right, let's uh see if we can get some sleep. 
And today we're going to start exploring the Black

0:00:59.200,0:01:14.640
Forest. We want to find us a copper mine and 
see if we can start extracting some of that ore.

0:01:14.640,0:01:20.240
We need to make our pickaxe. I thought we 
Oh, we did. We got the pickaxe. It's right

0:01:20.240,0:01:32.720
there. Let's Let's put this right up here. 
We don't need our backup bow for today.

0:01:32.720,0:01:40.960
And we may want our hoe. And let's put 
this one in with our backup gear. Let's

0:01:40.960,0:01:50.080
store these bees for some time later. want to 
just clean up this inventory. There's not a lot

0:01:50.080,0:02:00.000
of stuff we need. We might want a torch. 
So, let's hang on to a couple of resin.

0:02:00.000,0:02:07.760
And let's put the deer hide in here for now.

0:02:07.760,0:02:12.320
We do want some wood. Pick 
up a couple pieces as we go.

0:02:12.320,0:02:28.560
We'll want to build a crafting 
table so we can repair our pickaxe.

0:02:28.560,0:02:39.360
Oh, we got another raid. Here we go. Oh, 
we don't want them to tear up our This is

0:02:39.360,0:02:46.560
why you don't build a pin next to your 
base. Oh, these are grey dwarves. So,

0:02:46.560,0:02:55.120
we got a couple of guys here we going to 
worry about. We don't want him to poison us.

0:02:55.120,0:03:01.040
And we don't want that big guy beating us up. Um,

0:03:01.040,0:03:11.680
we need to eat. There we go. We're doing 
okay on everything else. Got to parry him

0:03:11.680,0:03:26.000
every time we can or he'll kill us and we're 
too low on health. Get away from my piggies.

0:03:26.000,0:03:29.200
Boy, we need some health.

0:03:31.120,0:03:34.400
Oh, five hit points. I don't know if we're going

0:03:34.400,0:03:43.200
to make it. I really don't. And 
they're going to free our pigs.

0:03:43.200,0:03:57.680
Oh, we got the big guy. That's a good start. 
Oh, but if they keep beating up on us,

0:03:59.680,0:04:05.920
Maybe we can use the bees to our advantage.

0:04:05.920,0:04:13.600
Got another big guy. And we're dead. Did we 
get poisoned? All right, we're going to have

0:04:13.600,0:04:17.840
to grab our corpse real quick. And then we're 
going have to run around and get dressed at

0:04:17.840,0:04:26.800
the same time. Not an easy thing to do. Okay, I 
hear the bees. We're going to respawn at our bed.

0:04:27.520,0:04:36.160
Let's get out of here. Get past that guy.

0:04:36.160,0:04:44.480
See what we can do. And we died again. 
Well, we've experienced our first death

0:04:44.480,0:04:52.960
here in Valheim. What a way to do 
it. I didn't even know we'd Well,

0:04:52.960,0:04:57.920
it doesn't really matter how long you stay around 
the base. Every time you're around the base,

0:04:57.920,0:05:06.480
there's a chance that it's going to roll up 
a raid. Oh, they're tearing up our beehives.

0:05:06.480,0:05:23.600
Okay, we got our items. Now we have a 
corpse run. The corpse run is a huge bonus.

0:05:28.320,0:05:34.000
There we go.

0:05:34.000,0:05:40.160
Need some stamina. We need to eat food.

0:05:40.160,0:05:47.600
We'll talk to you later.

0:05:47.600,0:05:51.360
I'll bet you they killed off our

0:05:53.440,0:06:05.840
Oh, we got that poison from that stupid shaman.

0:06:05.840,0:06:11.680
Got to get him out of the picture.

0:06:11.680,0:06:19.760
The raid's over, so we just 
got to deal with these guys.

0:06:24.720,0:06:28.800
Okay, that was fun. How much damage did they do?

0:06:28.800,0:06:39.600
And this is why I turn raids off. I 
don't like my base being destroyed.

0:06:39.600,0:06:45.040
Well, I'd say we did pretty good 
to get this far without dying. So,

0:06:45.040,0:06:52.880
it's not terrible. They 
did. They killed our bores.

0:06:52.880,0:06:57.520
So, we're going to start over on that 
part. So, what we should have done,

0:06:57.520,0:07:06.080
and I thought about this last night, is build a 
secondary perimeter fence out here so those shaman

0:07:06.080,0:07:15.520
just can't come up and poison our boores 
and kill them off. That is what happens.

0:07:20.320,0:07:34.960
Okay, let's do some quick repairs here.

0:07:34.960,0:07:41.160
Put that beehive back. [Music]

0:07:43.920,0:07:53.200
All is not lost. It's just a temporary setback.

0:07:53.200,0:08:00.320
Bees are happy. We're happy. Life is good.

0:08:00.320,0:08:09.840
[Music] So, we picked up uh an ancient 
seed. these ancient seeds. I believe we

0:08:09.840,0:08:17.360
need three of these to summon the elder 
who is the boss of the black forest. So,

0:08:17.360,0:08:30.800
we got that out of it. Um, puke berries are 
interesting. It's a consumable and if you eat it,

0:08:30.800,0:08:40.800
you will lose all the food in your stomach. 
It's really kind of gross to see it happen.

0:08:40.800,0:08:44.560
Um,

0:08:44.560,0:08:51.600
but if you happen to have the wrong 
food and you want to switch foods,

0:08:51.600,0:09:00.240
that's about the only way you can do 
it. Unless you just wait it out until

0:09:00.240,0:09:05.600
All right, we want our five stones so 
we don't have to pick up stones. And

0:09:05.600,0:09:14.160
I'd like to get rid of that 
bore meat, but we're kind of

0:09:14.160,0:09:22.480
kind of running low here on storage space.

0:09:22.480,0:09:23.840
Both of these are full.

0:09:26.880,0:09:31.760
I really don't

0:09:31.760,0:09:37.520
want more chests around. But

0:09:37.520,0:09:45.280
see, that's that habit of 
pushing eight or the hammer

0:09:45.280,0:09:49.360
and then you switch things around 
and it's not where you thought it

0:09:49.360,0:10:00.080
was. Guess I should really put this 
extra out in the storage building,

0:10:00.080,0:10:14.000
our storage shed. But all right, let's get 
out of here before we get another raid.

0:10:14.000,0:10:20.080
A black forest raid. At this point, 
we're still in our meadows armor.

0:10:20.080,0:10:25.600
It's not fully upgraded. Our 
weapons, our meadows level weapons,

0:10:25.600,0:10:36.400
and we're taught trying to fight off a raid 
from the Black Forest. Not at all surprising

0:10:36.400,0:10:42.480
that we didn't survive that 
without dying at least once. So,

0:10:42.480,0:10:49.200
a couple of things from that that we learned.

0:10:49.200,0:10:54.320
If

0:10:54.320,0:11:01.840
if you die, there's a timer up there. The no skill 
drain that skull and crossbones. That means if we

0:11:01.840,0:11:10.080
die again, like we died twice in a row while that 
timer is going, you won't lose any skill points.

0:11:10.080,0:11:18.240
So, we did lose 5% on our first death, but that 
second death didn't just pile on to the first one.

0:11:21.120,0:11:25.440
Am I going the right direction? 
I want to find that. Yeah,

0:11:25.440,0:11:30.560
we want to find the edge of this black forest

0:11:30.560,0:11:39.200
since we're going to be doing mushroom runs 
in the future. Let's mark this guy on our map.

0:11:39.200,0:11:44.480
There we can see where our deaths occurred.

0:11:44.480,0:11:53.200
And if you die a long way from your base, let's 
see, these are mushrooms. Okay, here we go. If

0:11:53.200,0:11:58.640
you die a long way from your from your base, 
it's nice to know where your corpse is. So, you

0:11:58.640,0:12:09.520
use that little icon, bring up your map, find out 
where you did, died, go get all your stuff back.

0:12:09.520,0:12:13.440
All right, here's the black forest. 
Oh, here's some more mushrooms.

0:12:13.440,0:12:28.320
We'll mark these two. That's good. 
Two nice patches right in a row.

0:12:28.320,0:12:36.400
And what we're going to try to do today is 
just run along this edge and locate a copper

0:12:36.400,0:12:47.040
vein or two or three. While we're here, let's 
go ahead and demonstrate mining ore. I want to

0:12:47.040,0:12:58.800
switch these around just because I'm used 
to pushing eight. I will go one to mine.

0:12:58.800,0:13:06.640
Got to keep your eye up because this is 
going to draw the trolls attention. And

0:13:06.640,0:13:13.840
bird brain wants to talk to us. Found ore. 
Raw ore needs to be refined in a smelter.

0:13:13.840,0:13:18.960
Before you can work at the forge to build a 
smelter, you'll need certling cores. Luckily,

0:13:18.960,0:13:26.800
we've got our first certling cores. We can 
start smelting this ore as soon as we get back

0:13:26.800,0:13:36.720
to base. If we go ahead and build the smelter 
since we only have five certling cores and it

0:13:36.720,0:13:55.680
takes two 10 to build the smel the smelter 
and the kiln. We're going to build a kiln.

0:13:55.680,0:13:57.920
All right, let me concentrate on what I'm saying

0:13:57.920,0:14:07.200
here. We're going to build a kiln. 
We're going to make a whole bunch of

0:14:07.200,0:14:14.080
coal that we'll need to smelt the ore 
with. And then we'll tear down the

0:14:14.080,0:14:21.800
smelter and use the materials 
to make the kiln. And we can

0:14:21.800,0:14:30.800
[Music] turn this or

0:14:30.800,0:14:39.520
All right, that's enough. Uh 10 for now.

0:14:45.600,0:14:52.080
Once you start killing trade grey dwarfs, you 
find you get a lot more wood cuz they drop wood,

0:14:52.080,0:15:00.320
stone, and grey dwarf eyes. All 
right, that spawner over there,

0:15:00.320,0:15:06.640
we're going to just get a continuous 
source. We're looking for rocks like this.

0:15:06.640,0:15:15.920
you'll find one that has shiny veins going 
through it. And that that's a copper vein. But

0:15:15.920,0:15:31.040
we're going to just go around looking for these 
kind of rocks that stick up out of the ground.

0:15:31.040,0:15:35.840
Like that one right there. 
And then if you hover over it,

0:15:35.840,0:15:44.640
it'll tell you it's a copper vein. 
Got lots more tin that we can

0:15:44.640,0:15:56.240
start extracting.

0:15:56.240,0:16:03.360
Just looking for those big rocks.

0:16:03.360,0:16:14.800
At the same time, we want to 
avoid running into a troll.

0:16:14.800,0:16:22.880
Especially the one with the log. That big 
guy with the log we're not ready for yet.

0:16:22.880,0:16:30.400
Wouldn't

0:16:30.400,0:16:34.320
mind finding a copper vein like 
this big rock here where it's on

0:16:34.320,0:16:52.160
an overhang because then more of it's 
exposed and there's less to dig out.

0:16:54.880,0:17:03.600
Sounds like we got some D 
great dwarfs on our heels.

0:17:03.600,0:17:17.600
Hi there, buddy.

0:17:22.800,0:17:30.640
Wonder if this is the grey dwarf lore. They 
don't speak very highly of the grey dwarfs.

0:17:30.640,0:17:43.760
Beware the grey dwarfs. The soul of a 
murderer. Interesting lore. Moving on.

0:17:43.760,0:17:46.880
Now,

0:17:46.880,0:17:55.280
each biome has its own little theme. 
This one's not near as peaceful as

0:17:55.280,0:18:01.840
when we're in the meadows. Oh, here 
we go. Wait, this is this is that Oh,

0:18:01.840,0:18:12.320
look. Right there's a another burial 
chamber. But I think that's where that

0:18:12.320,0:18:17.120
I think this is where that troll was.

0:18:17.120,0:18:21.840
We got to be careful around here.

0:18:21.840,0:18:26.160
Explore this.

0:18:26.160,0:18:34.400
Are we that close to the Yeah, we are. Looks 
like that's the same one. It's almost nightfall.

0:18:38.720,0:18:49.200
All right, tomorrow. Let's come back here and see 
if we can get some more surfing cores out of that.

0:18:49.200,0:18:52.960
And let's see if we can get 
out of here without running

0:18:52.960,0:19:01.360
into a troll or a bear. The bear will be hard.

0:19:02.960,0:19:16.400
Not as hard as that troll with the I 
don't know if we can take him or not.

0:19:16.400,0:19:27.760
Should have rolled dodge rolled that. Oh, that 
hurt. All right, let's fall back. Try this again.

0:19:34.720,0:19:39.360
should have dodge rolled. Oh, we're 
we're real low on health. And there's

0:19:39.360,0:19:50.080
our third death of the game. going to quit 
counting how many cuz there'll be a lot,

0:19:50.080,0:20:00.080
especially until we can get some uh black 
forest tiered weapons and armor. Let's

0:20:00.080,0:20:07.040
sweep this one off. We can go do the 
corpse run first thing in the morning.

0:20:09.600,0:20:14.240
Now, this is where it would be nice 
to have a backup food source. Maybe

0:20:14.240,0:20:18.640
some meat, you know, that's already cooked. Um,

0:20:18.640,0:20:30.640
that way we can eat before we take off on 
this corpse run. Uh, none there. None there.

0:20:30.640,0:20:45.200
Not there. Or there. All right, we're 
going to cook a couple of these.

0:20:45.200,0:20:50.320
And let's cook a couple of these.

0:20:50.320,0:20:57.520
And let's eat some honey.

0:21:03.520,0:21:08.080
Why is there only three things on? I thought

0:21:08.080,0:21:26.240
I got two. I must have only 
gotten one. We only need one.

0:21:28.560,0:21:34.160
And where do we put that extra storage 
shelf? We'll just put this over here.

0:21:34.160,0:21:41.200
We'll use that for emergency food. All 
right. So, we check the map. And there's

0:21:41.200,0:21:51.520
where we died. Going to run over there and 
grab our corpse. Try to avoid anything.

0:21:51.520,0:21:56.800
That bear probably went back to the 
black forest. Gonna run around this

0:21:56.800,0:22:10.800
griling. There's our tombstone. We'll grab 
that. Let's get dressed as quick as we can.

0:22:10.800,0:22:20.480
That's just a grrey lane, so he's not going 
to kill us. He just doesn't hit hard enough.

0:22:20.480,0:22:24.960
Big difference between the grrey and the grey 
dwarfs, even though they look very similar.

0:22:28.960,0:22:38.640
All right. Now, if we head back to the 
forest, we want to avoid that bear.

0:22:38.640,0:22:42.160
I just don't feel confident 
enough. We could take him down,

0:22:42.160,0:22:52.720
but I'm not very consistent with my parries 
and dodge rolls, and it's a long fight.

0:22:54.960,0:22:58.560
There he is.

0:22:58.560,0:23:05.680
He smelled us. Well, he didn't smell 
us. We just got within his aggro range.

0:23:05.680,0:23:10.560
Is he still after us?

0:23:10.560,0:23:13.920
Could be.

0:23:13.920,0:23:20.880
Here's here's another way we 
could do this. We can kite him.

0:23:20.880,0:23:26.560
Oh, sorry about that. my 
alarm to wake up this morning.

0:23:26.560,0:23:32.000
Didn't need that cuz I woke up two hours ago.

0:23:32.000,0:23:38.400
So, what we want to do is use pathing

0:23:38.400,0:23:40.560
and just kind of stay away from him. Now,

0:23:40.560,0:23:48.160
he's fast. This is easier to kite 
a troll than it is this big bear.

0:23:49.680,0:24:03.360
See, can't let him catch up with us 
like that, cuz that's a chunk of health,

0:24:03.360,0:24:13.840
but we can put obstacles in front of him 
and use the pathing. And this takes a while.

0:24:13.840,0:24:41.840
That took another chunk of health off of 
us. He's on our Oh man, he's got some reach.

0:24:41.840,0:24:46.080
He's not real mobile, so we 
can turn faster than he can.

0:24:50.400,0:25:06.640
I might missing him every time.

0:25:06.640,0:25:13.120
Got back the uh bow skill we lost.

0:25:13.120,0:25:14.960
Come on back here.

0:25:17.360,0:25:34.800
Don't want to put that effort in and 
just have him go away. Here we go.

0:25:34.800,0:25:39.680
There's our dodge roll.

0:25:43.360,0:25:56.400
There's a fairy, but little late. All right, 
let's get some health back. Put that away. Ouch.

0:25:56.400,0:26:04.480
He had a little pathing issue around this 
pin. Maybe we can use that to our advantage.

0:26:07.120,0:26:17.520
He's not had a pathing issue 
now. Guess he figured that out.

0:26:17.520,0:26:28.400
So, he's pretty easy to dodge if you stay 
close. I say easy. I'm not very good at it.

0:26:28.400,0:26:33.760
Yeah. Took that one on the chin.

0:26:34.880,0:26:45.200
And that one. Now we're down to 19 
hit points. Got to get out of here.

0:26:45.200,0:26:52.800
I'll bet you he doesn't like our bees.

0:26:52.800,0:26:59.360
He might tear up our house.

0:26:59.360,0:27:02.080
Can I come over the top?

0:27:10.480,0:27:16.080
So there's those pathing issues.

0:27:16.080,0:27:23.280
He loses us. [Music]

0:27:23.280,0:27:29.440
Got him. Is that going to get him to come back?

0:27:36.720,0:27:45.200
He's not worth this fight, but I'm stubborn.

0:27:45.200,0:27:52.640
Come on, big guy. Come on.

0:27:52.640,0:27:57.600
There we go. Oh, double 
attack. Wasn't ready for that.

0:28:05.760,0:28:16.080
should have dodge rolled. And there we go.

0:28:16.080,0:28:21.440
Can make a nice bear hagged rug. We can 
make some bare armor. We can make those

0:28:21.440,0:28:26.800
hand weapons. Those hand weapons are kind 
of fun if you want to do handtohand combat.

0:28:29.760,0:28:35.200
I'm surprised we didn't see any

0:28:35.200,0:28:40.240
copper on this trip.

0:28:40.240,0:28:50.560
So, I suppose the next thing that's going to 
happen is we're going to encounter that troll.

0:28:50.560,0:29:01.920
All right, we're we want to make our 
way back. So, there's a burial chamber

0:29:01.920,0:29:13.200
right there. That's another one. That's not 
the same one we went in to begin with, is it?

0:29:13.200,0:29:21.760
We'll know if we go in there. And 
our fire's still there. Blueberries.

0:29:21.760,0:29:25.200
Now, we can create the patterns of the bear armor.

0:29:27.440,0:29:34.320
mixed feelings about that patterns 
of the bear armor. It comes with a

0:29:34.320,0:29:46.480
nice armor class, but it also comes 
with reduced additional damage. So,

0:29:46.480,0:29:50.800
real mixed feelings. This is the one we were 
in before. There's not much reason unless

0:29:50.800,0:30:09.360
we want to collect yellow mushrooms. 
There's no reason to continue in here.

0:30:09.360,0:30:16.560
No copper. That's surprising.

0:30:16.560,0:30:22.960
Well, and that was my concern when I was 
looking at the size of this black forest.

0:30:49.440,0:30:51.840
See some blueberries over here.

0:30:58.000,0:31:04.080
So, we've got tons of tin. 
Not much we can make out of

0:31:04.080,0:31:10.240
10. It's usually used in combination with copper

0:31:10.240,0:31:18.880
to make bronze armor or bronze. And out 
of bronze, we can make bronze armor,

0:31:18.880,0:31:30.800
bronze tools. That's our goal is to get the 
Black Forest tiered tools and weapons and armor.

0:31:30.800,0:31:42.160
But without copper, that's not going to 
happen. This is just a rock, I'm sure. Yeah.

0:31:42.160,0:31:48.960
Lots and lots of tin deposits.

0:31:53.120,0:32:07.040
That another bear. No, that's a great Orf.

0:32:07.040,0:32:12.000
There's a Grey dwarf spawner.

0:32:12.000,0:32:16.720
I say we Oh, there's the troll.

0:32:29.040,0:32:37.840
That is not the one with the club. Let's get out 
of here. I don't really want It's a long fight.

0:32:37.840,0:32:45.360
We need our rusted buff for sure for fighting 
a troll or taking out that Grey Dwarf spawner.

0:32:46.640,0:32:52.080
Let's just see if we can get out of here.

0:32:52.080,0:33:03.120
Oh, those are starred grey dwarfs. 
You could tell by his blue skin.

0:33:03.120,0:33:08.960
And I just want to get far enough 
away that we don't get that that

0:33:08.960,0:33:15.120
guy's attention. Is that another bear 
over there? Or is that a tree stump?

0:33:15.120,0:33:31.680
I hope it's a tree stump. It's a bear. Dog gone 
it. No luck at all. And a troll. Now we're dead.

0:33:31.680,0:33:35.200
Out of stamina.

0:33:35.200,0:33:44.000
Got that troll on our heels. If it was just 
him, we could kite him around like we did the

0:33:44.000,0:33:55.520
uh bear. He's easier to kite 
because he pauses for his attacks.

0:33:55.520,0:34:06.800
Now listen to his steps. And when he 
goes to swing at us, he'll stop walking

0:34:06.800,0:34:17.680
right there. So now we can hit him. But we 
got all those dog on gray dwarfs on us, too.

0:34:20.560,0:34:31.280
The nice thing about that troll is if we killed 
him and we get his hides. Oh, we got to watch our

0:34:31.280,0:34:36.160
[Music]

0:34:36.160,0:34:45.760
See, we develop this whole train of things chasing 
us and it gets harder and harder to survive.

0:34:49.840,0:35:14.720
We got the trolls. We've got the Bors. We 
got the twostar. Oh, don't go after my house.

0:35:14.720,0:35:22.080
Uh-oh. But where'd he go? That boar is the 
easiest one to get rid of. He's going back

0:35:22.080,0:35:41.280
towards our house. Let's see what we can 
do about some of this train we've got.

0:35:41.280,0:35:43.520
[Music]

0:35:43.520,0:35:55.680
[Music] Use those parries to our advantage.

0:35:55.680,0:36:02.480
Did he go after the house or did he just go back?

0:36:02.480,0:36:08.640
Got a We've got I don't know. Too much stuff.

0:36:10.480,0:36:13.680
Wow.

0:36:13.680,0:36:22.480
I wouldn't mind. Oh, yeah. He is attacking 
the house. All right, let's get his attention.

0:36:22.480,0:36:27.360
We're out of honey. That's too bad.

0:36:27.360,0:36:32.000
We need a stamina food.

0:36:32.000,0:36:37.360
Best we got is if we could switch 
out and grab some of those mushrooms.

0:36:38.720,0:36:46.240
See how he stops to attack? 
That's to our advantage.

0:36:46.240,0:36:55.840
Get some stamina back. We got no rested 
buff. We've got no stamina food. Um,

0:36:55.840,0:37:01.200
that's 25 stamina. That's better than nothing.

0:37:01.200,0:37:20.880
Got a little bigger stamina pool now. 
We're just going to do that until he dies.

0:37:20.880,0:37:26.480
Close to half health.

0:37:26.480,0:37:33.360
I don't want to destroy our base, but if we 
drag him through the bees, I think the bees

0:37:34.080,0:37:43.520
will poison him and help take 
down his health a little bit.

0:37:43.520,0:37:53.680
Yeah, he doesn't like those bees, but he doesn't 
like being on fire more. That was too close.

0:37:53.680,0:38:01.200
Oh, let's come over here and see if he'll 
take down one of these white trees for us.

0:38:08.160,0:38:16.560
Just going to stand on the other side of this and 
let him swing at me. Wrong tree, buddy. Nope. He

0:38:16.560,0:38:28.960
got it. Oh, break broke it. Break it again. 
Break it again. Oh, that was too uh painful.

0:38:40.960,0:38:47.120
Oh, now we get another train of things behind us.

0:38:47.120,0:38:56.320
There's a welltimed dodge roll. 
And another welltimed dodge roll.

0:38:56.320,0:38:58.240
Oh, ran into my own fence.

0:39:05.280,0:39:13.600
really like to see this over before nightfall.

0:39:13.600,0:39:21.760
That was not a so welltimed dodge 
roll. Need some stamina. Problem

0:39:21.760,0:39:25.840
with this is we can't see where we're headed.

0:39:30.880,0:39:40.640
That's what I mean by the stopping, 
which just takes us right out of range.

0:39:40.640,0:39:51.040
All right, that's kind of open to Oh, we got him. 
The fire dot killed him when we weren't looking.

0:39:55.200,0:40:03.840
All right. I don't think there's anything we can 
build with one troll. Well, we do get some nice

0:40:03.840,0:40:11.520
uh gold coins. Well, let's let's put down a 
stack of wood right here. That'll be easy to come

0:40:11.520,0:40:28.800
back for, and that'll free up some uh inventory 
space. And there's our trollhide armor recipes.

0:40:28.800,0:40:39.200
Picked up the last of that troll hide. And 
look at the mess he made or wood. There's

0:40:39.200,0:40:49.600
rocks. All kinds of stuff that he breaks out 
of the ground with that giant glove of his.

0:40:50.240,0:41:03.040
Luckily, it wasn't us and our bee. It's 
night time. Let's rest. Uh, that was an

0:41:03.040,0:41:11.760
exciting trip into the black forest. U, we'll 
stop this one here. Tomorrow, let's start on

0:41:11.760,0:41:20.240
um our kil and creating charcoal. Um, we might 
even demonstrate turning some of this tin

0:41:20.240,0:41:31.520
into metal ingots. Thanks y'all for joining. I'm 
Grandpa Bud. We're playing Valheim. It's been fun.
