## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
The silence of the Meadows is broken. To prove his worth to the Allfather, Conrad must face Eikthyr—the massive cosmic stag that stands between an exiled warrior and his survival.

This is more than a hunt; it is a ritual of blood and lightning.

Though Conrad’s journey through the Meadows is still unfolding (see the Chronicles of the Exiled playlist below), the Norns have offered us a glimpse into his future trial. May the thunder guide his shield.

Uh, where is he? Over here.

0:00:16.640,0:00:27.600
There he is. Get a couple hits in. 
Get out of the way. Switch to our bow.

0:00:27.600,0:00:38.080

0:00:53.440,0:00:57.360
Ouch.

0:01:04.960,0:01:12.160
This is why we wanted a clear area to fight.

Keep an eye on the points.

0:01:20.560,0:01:31.120

0:01:38.640,0:01:44.160
He's having some padding issues.

0:01:44.160,0:01:50.240
We could use that to our advantage.

0:01:50.240,0:02:05.840
That's why we cleared out. Don't like 
this. No, no clear line of sight.

0:02:05.840,0:02:16.400

All of our stamina.
