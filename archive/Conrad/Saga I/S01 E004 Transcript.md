The peace of the Meadows is a lie. As Conrad completes his ancestral hall, the Great Stag Eikthyr sends his first warning. In this chronicle, we master the art of the Viking hearth, secure the bounty of the bees, and defend our home against the first of many raids.

An old man knows that a sturdy roof keeps the rain out, but a sturdy wall keeps the shadows at bay. The trial is intensifying, and the halls of Valhalla are watching how we hold our ground.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:02.400,0:00:12.080
Okay, welcome back. I'm Grandpa and we're 
playing Valheim. Let's get this started.

0:00:12.080,0:00:20.400
Good old Conrad is ready to enter Terra 
Conrad. This is a random seed. Never never

0:00:20.400,0:00:26.160
seen this world prior to playing 
with Conrad. Um, as you can see,

0:00:26.160,0:00:33.520
there played a few different times on Valheim. 
Too many hours to even mention. All right,

0:00:33.520,0:00:41.040
I think this is the end of day five. We're going 
to go ahead and go to sleep. Tomorrow, we'll start

0:00:41.040,0:00:50.000
day six. We'll try to wrap up house that we 
started and have our real our first, you know,

0:00:50.000,0:01:07.840
real base. From here, we're going to explore in 
a few different directions. See what we can find.

0:01:07.840,0:01:14.720
So dark first time, first thing in the morning.

0:01:14.720,0:01:18.960
Carrying too much. Well, 
that won't take long to cure.

0:01:20.480,0:01:25.840
Keep going on this roof. Going into the 
building. I think I called this a 26

0:01:25.840,0:01:41.440
inch yesterday. It's a 26 degree 
roof versus the 45 degree roof.

0:01:41.440,0:01:47.840
And then we'll drop the 26 
degree bridge. Rough bridge.

0:01:57.200,0:02:06.080
And we could just stop there and have a decent 
little house. But let's add a floor. Let's

0:02:06.080,0:02:15.680
go see. I see Hugan wants to Hugan wants 
to talk to us. What's he got to say? Oh,

0:02:15.680,0:02:26.960
telling us that we were overweight. 
Yeah, don't call me fat bird brain.

0:02:26.960,0:02:33.760
I'm going to clear that as we laid 
down those uh pieces to outline the

0:02:33.760,0:02:43.200
house. We really don't need them 
at this time. Uh right now we're

0:02:43.200,0:02:49.200
using them to bind to

0:02:49.200,0:02:54.480
that's not in the right place. There we go.

0:02:54.480,0:03:00.160
Something's not right. We 
should be above the dirt.

0:03:00.160,0:03:10.480
What do we get here? That's there. There. Change 
our binding point. See if we can get a better.

0:03:10.480,0:03:22.400
Would really help if I could see what I'm doing. 
Still so dark this early in the morning. Auto.

0:03:22.400,0:03:27.120
Is that really right? Are we really that? Guess

0:03:27.120,0:03:32.240
we're going to have some dirt 
showing. That's unfortunate.

0:03:33.440,0:03:44.800
I got to be binding this in the wrong place. 
Snapping the wrong place. Not binding.

0:03:44.800,0:03:54.960
Going to move that crafting table.

0:03:54.960,0:04:01.200
That just doesn't seem right. We should be able 
to have a floor without any dirt showing. Let's

0:04:01.200,0:04:15.200
go over here to the low spot and then let's level 
the earth and see if we can't. That's better.

0:04:15.200,0:04:19.760
So, by standing in the low spot 
and leveling everything to it,

0:04:19.760,0:04:26.560
we're able to not have that dirt 
show through the floorboards.

0:04:26.560,0:04:29.440
Go back to putting down the floor.

0:04:40.480,0:04:57.360
Wrong spot.

0:04:57.360,0:05:01.360
Now, we could stay with this big open 
view, but let's close it off a little

0:05:01.360,0:05:14.000
bit just to make it a little cozier. Gonna 
do the 26 degree wood wall and do that to

0:05:14.000,0:05:18.960
close off these end pieces.

0:05:18.960,0:05:25.920
Looks like we didn't put a rafter 
in over here. Do that real quick.

0:05:28.320,0:05:42.080
Go back to that 26 degree and do the other 
side. It's not quite square. There we go.

0:05:42.080,0:05:46.240
Put the 26° cross. Let's get a different bottom

0:05:46.240,0:05:54.560
one. Bottom one. And then 
we'll use this half wall.

0:06:37.920,0:06:48.720
So, that'll finish off most of the inside. 
Let's get our bed in here. And we need more

0:06:48.720,0:07:10.240
more wood. As always, never have enough 
wood. So, back to chopping down trees.

0:07:11.520,0:07:35.680
Looks like we got a log over there we didn't 
cut up last time. Don't let that fall on you.

0:07:41.120,0:07:46.160
Going to have to eat something 
here pretty soon. I'm sorry.

0:07:46.160,0:08:02.800
Cook something. We're running out of cooked food.

0:08:07.840,0:08:18.080
Nice peaceful morning in the meadows. Got that 
deer over there. Let's um let's go get us a

0:08:18.080,0:08:29.120
little more leather cuz after we get this house 
built, we want to start working on our armor.

0:08:29.120,0:08:38.880
Let the stamina come back. should be able to get 
the shot from here. I find aiming just around the

0:08:38.880,0:08:50.120
R and right below the red line depending on your 
distance, but that usually works out pretty well.

0:08:50.120,0:09:00.880
[Music] Hold still there. Now the [Music] ground's 
a little off for us. Let's give that a shot.

0:09:09.440,0:09:28.160
There's his buddy. I knew he'd be there 
and I didn't sneak like I should have.

0:09:28.160,0:09:41.920
We probably have enough raspberries for a while.

0:09:41.920,0:09:48.880
So, we've got the fires exposed a little 
bit here. That's not going to cause us

0:09:48.880,0:09:54.960
a problem. Not necessarily the way we 
want it, but it won't hurt anything. So,

0:09:54.960,0:10:05.120
I think I'll just leave it like that. 
Let's go ahead and close off this chimney.

0:10:05.120,0:10:23.920
Uh take that out and we'll put in a full 
height there and then go all the way around.

0:10:23.920,0:10:34.400
Come on. Get a good snapping point here.

0:10:34.400,0:10:43.040
Now, I'm just going to throw a little 
scaffolding up so I can access the roof,

0:10:43.040,0:10:52.960
finish up this chimney the way 
I want it. We could just slap um

0:10:54.720,0:11:04.080
like a uh 45 roof on here and be done 
with it. Um, it works perfectly fine.

0:11:04.080,0:11:12.400
Not necessarily the way I like to do it. So, 
I'm going to give it a little air space and

0:11:12.400,0:11:21.920
then top it with a roof bridge just cuz I 
think that has a little nicer look to it.

0:11:21.920,0:11:28.240
bottom one. That'd be this one. Let's 
see if that's going to be enough

0:11:28.240,0:11:35.920
uh air that our fire doesn't go out. If you 
if you close that chimney off too tight,

0:11:35.920,0:11:43.120
the fire will quit getting oxygen and it'll 
go out. It'll come back on and go out. Oh,

0:11:43.120,0:11:51.760
by the way, these lines show the limit of your 
workbench. And sometimes you'll see a switch lines

0:11:51.760,0:11:57.920
and that's where we have switched workbenches. 
So over here we're within the perimeters of the

0:11:57.920,0:12:03.920
workbench in that house. We out leave that 
perimeter. This is the limits of what that

0:12:03.920,0:12:11.200
workbench will work with. We step out here and 
we see the workbench starts flashing red. We

0:12:11.200,0:12:17.440
don't have a workbench close enough so we can't 
build. step inside the perimeter and we can build

0:12:17.440,0:12:28.800
anywhere inside this perimeter. You can stand 
on the edge and build outside the perimeter. Um,

0:12:28.800,0:12:35.840
but that's what that white line 
is. Okay, let's put our bed.

0:12:35.840,0:12:43.280
I think I want to move that crafting table. 
We'll put our crafting table right here.

0:12:45.520,0:12:48.560
And later we're going to need some other crafting

0:12:48.560,0:12:53.600
tables. I keep calling this a crafting 
table. It's actually the workbench. So,

0:12:53.600,0:13:00.000
pardon me for using the wrong terminology. 
And then we'll use our our next workbench.

0:13:00.000,0:13:10.480
We'll go here on the other side or maybe over 
here. Let's put our bed right next to the fire.

0:13:17.920,0:13:23.040
We'll drop a little U

0:13:23.040,0:13:39.520
chest right here for a foot locker. So, 
we've got some storage. Put one over here.

0:13:43.680,0:13:59.840
And uh eventually we're going to need a lot of 
storage and we'll be building lots of chests.

0:13:59.840,0:14:06.640
Almost too low on that one. Looked like it hit 
down around his ankles. If a deer has ankles,

0:14:06.640,0:14:12.960
does a deer have ankles? That's one of 
the great mysteries of the world. No,

0:14:12.960,0:14:23.280
I don't think a deer has ankles. 
I don't think we care either.

0:14:23.280,0:14:32.720
Just grabbing that easy stuff that's 
laying around. Let's get rid of this stump.

0:14:39.680,0:14:45.120
Just try to keep things clean so we don't 
have to draw extra stuff. Keep the game

0:14:45.120,0:14:57.440
running smooth. I've never had a problem 
with it lagging, but happens sometimes.

0:14:57.440,0:15:01.440
Put that hammer away so that 
we can run more efficiently.

0:15:02.720,0:15:09.280
So, you can see we've got this uh budded 
roof line. It's not the best looking. Uh

0:15:09.280,0:15:13.440
having a little overhang makes a 
much more attractive roof line.

0:15:13.440,0:15:24.240
Little more attractive house. But right 
now, we just wanted a basic basic house

0:15:24.240,0:15:33.600
that'll serve us as a base for a while. We'll 
probably expand on this a little bit later. Okay,

0:15:33.600,0:15:43.200
let's uh put food over here. Um because this 
is where we're going to want to do our cooking.

0:15:43.200,0:15:52.800
And let's put crafting supplies, 
that kind of stuff over here.

0:15:52.800,0:16:02.320
whatever else we run into. This fills 
up pretty quick as you can see. So,

0:16:02.320,0:16:13.200
we're going to want to have 
more storage before too long.

0:16:13.200,0:16:16.400
Keep these good torches in storage. And let's use

0:16:16.400,0:16:21.280
up that one as we need it. 
Not going to need that club.

0:16:23.520,0:16:29.280
Oh, I think that's our first daytime rainstorm,

0:16:29.280,0:16:36.880
which the rain that introduces a um

0:16:36.880,0:16:45.200
wet debuff. And if you have the wet debuff, if 
we'll step outside, we get wet. And you can see

0:16:45.200,0:16:51.440
the wet debuff up in the upper right. That's going 
to slow down our health generation and our stamina

0:16:51.440,0:16:58.720
generation. Um, makes fighting a little bit 
harder. We come in into shelter, stand next to the

0:16:58.720,0:17:09.120
fire, and uh, that'll dry us out a lot quicker. 
Otherwise, it takes about 2 minutes to dry off.

0:17:10.480,0:17:23.680
So if we come over here to the workbench 
and besides repairs we want to craft

0:17:23.680,0:17:27.760
we don't have

0:17:27.760,0:17:37.920
we have not unlocked the recipe for deer or 
leather armor. I'm not sure what that's all about.

0:17:39.360,0:17:50.240
I thought we had seen that earlier. 
We can create a rag tunic. We can do

0:17:50.240,0:17:59.040
I'll bet we need to upgrade our workbench. Let's 
see what upgrades we've got available here. So, we

0:17:59.040,0:18:05.920
come over here. Everything between the workbench 
and the beehive that we see right now, the things

0:18:05.920,0:18:13.280
that immediately follow, these are workbench 
improvements. So, for this workbench improvement,

0:18:13.280,0:18:21.600
uh the chopping block, then we need 10 wood and 
10 flint. And then that'll unlock additional

0:18:21.600,0:18:28.080
recipes that we're not seeing when we go to the 
recipe. So, this list is going to get longer.

0:18:28.800,0:18:36.240
So, let's grab the 10. Now, I'm holding 
down shiftclick so that I can do a split

0:18:36.240,0:18:49.440
on that. We've only got six wood, so we're 
going to go out in the rain and chop wood.

0:18:56.400,0:19:03.920
And got to remember to keep eating. We 
don't have any cooked food. So right now

0:19:03.920,0:19:16.800
we're limited to just two foods. 
So less hit points, lower health.

0:19:16.800,0:19:21.520
If we were to be attacked by something deadly,

0:19:21.520,0:19:34.160
it could be real dangerous. Swinging too high 
to get the stump. So, move the other side.

0:19:34.160,0:19:42.480
I cannot tell how late in the 
day it is with this heavy a rain.

0:19:49.360,0:19:56.480
So, the upgrades need to go near the workbench. 
I'm going to put them on the outside of the

0:19:56.480,0:20:06.960
building so they don't clutter up their inside the 
workbench area and we've got more room inside. So,

0:20:06.960,0:20:14.880
this looks like a good spot. Uh you can see it's 
it's got to be kind of close to the workbench. And

0:20:14.880,0:20:21.440
then the next upgrade is the tanning rack. We're 
going to need 20 leather scraps, five deer hide,

0:20:21.440,0:20:29.440
and 15 flint. But let's see what recipes 
that added to our list. There we go. New

0:20:29.440,0:20:44.240
station level workbench 2. Now we can make our 
deer hide. So, what do we need for deer hide?

0:20:44.240,0:20:49.600
We can make the leather helmet. We 
since we're not wearing a helmet. Oh,

0:20:49.600,0:20:59.680
our first raid. We've been 
around. This is going to be fun.

0:20:59.680,0:21:05.520
Probably want to get outside or we're 
going to get our house destroyed in a raid.

0:21:05.520,0:21:13.600
As it says, he clears rallying 
the forest creatures on us.

0:21:13.600,0:21:25.520
With our low health, this could be really 
dangerous. We may see our first death.

0:21:25.520,0:21:31.280
Don't want to.

0:21:31.280,0:21:34.320
Let's go ahead and eat a strawberry, a mushroom,

0:21:34.320,0:21:45.840
because we're getting low. 
Here comes several at once.

0:21:45.840,0:21:49.440
Talk a little bit more about 
raids when I can focus on what

0:21:49.440,0:22:13.985
I'm saying. But basically here it comes. 
Now the cold that means it is nighttime.

0:22:13.985,0:22:13.992
[Music]

0:22:13.992,0:22:19.200
[Music] Creatures are calming down and 
our health has gotten a little low. Oh,

0:22:19.200,0:22:33.120
we got down to 12 hit points. Maybe 
a little lower even. Hi, Hugan.

0:22:33.120,0:22:40.880
So, about once a day, I believe it is, and 
that's a day and a night time. Once every 30

0:22:40.880,0:22:50.160
minutes in game, the game's going to check for 
the possibility of a raid. And if you're around

0:22:50.160,0:23:00.240
your home base, if you're around a workbench 
structure, um there's a chance, it's like 30%

0:23:00.240,0:23:06.560
chance of a raid. And there's multiple kinds of 
raids. As the game progresses, they get harder and

0:23:06.560,0:23:17.200
harder. And uh you can change the raid settings 
and reduce the number of raids in the settings

0:23:17.200,0:23:31.360
menu. If we come up here, we go to settings, 
game play. Uh oh, it's in the world settings.

0:23:31.360,0:23:37.200
So, not here, but we'd have to quit the game

0:23:37.200,0:23:43.680
and take a look at it. Let's go 
ahead and make this workstation

0:23:43.680,0:23:48.080
so that we can cook some food 
cuz we need that extra health,

0:23:48.080,0:23:58.640
especially for something like a raids.

0:23:58.640,0:24:05.920
We want to cook that bore meat and that neck 
meat so that we have two sources of protein. And

0:24:05.920,0:24:11.440
uh we'll be a little more health focused instead 
of the even mix that we've been running. And by

0:24:11.440,0:24:21.680
that I mean we'll have two of the red forked 
foods instead of a red, a yellow, and a white.

0:24:23.600,0:24:26.720
be so glad when this cold is over because

0:24:26.720,0:24:36.000
man it gets tiresome and I can't 
talk right. I sound real nasly.

0:24:36.000,0:24:48.800
At least to me I do.

0:24:48.800,0:24:53.280
It's dangerous having that food up there. 
you get used to that and you start hitting

0:24:53.280,0:25:01.040
it automatically. Eventually, we replace that 
and then you end up using an item you don't want

0:25:01.040,0:25:14.320
to use. But maybe you'll be better at learning 
that than I am. I developed these bad habits.

0:25:14.320,0:25:19.440
Oh, let's put the meat on there 
to cook so it can get done. Jeez.

0:25:21.600,0:25:28.160
And then I have a hard time 
breaking that bad habit.

0:25:28.160,0:25:34.480
I just automatically think, "Oh, I 
got to eat five, six, seven." Uh,

0:25:34.480,0:25:47.200
and then it has a completely different effect 
because I've rolled out what's on my hot bar.

0:25:47.200,0:25:50.880
All right. What do we want? 
We want stamina heavy. Yeah,

0:25:50.880,0:26:02.880
let's drop the mushrooms. We'll 
stick with the raspberries.

0:26:02.880,0:26:08.480
And once we get this food cooked, we're going 
to end the night. I think we're done with

0:26:08.480,0:26:16.240
everything in the base. And we'll look at what 
it's going to take to make that leather armor.

0:26:20.400,0:26:25.120
That's the last of the neck meat 
that we've got in our inventory. So,

0:26:25.120,0:26:35.760
we'll call it there. Hopefully, it 
won't be raining in the morning.

0:26:35.760,0:26:45.840
Pretty happy. Nice, comfortable little 
base. Has a basic covers the needs.

0:26:45.840,0:26:54.400
set a new spawn point. Let's go to sleep. 
Oh, tomorrow morning we want to build

0:26:54.400,0:27:02.640
uh the beehive so we can start collecting honey. 
Get that extra stamina. I think that's the highest

0:27:02.640,0:27:13.600
stamina food for this biome. So, here we go. 
Day seven. We're making decent progress. the

0:27:13.600,0:27:19.760
the world generated pretty well for us. Let's 
take start with the leather helmet since we don't

0:27:19.760,0:27:29.040
have a helmet at all. And that's going to take 
six of the leather we have. We've only got 12

0:27:29.040,0:27:36.560
and going to drop that in here. Let's move 
the rest of this stuff over. Probably don't

0:27:36.560,0:27:44.880
need to carry that around with us. 
And then so now we've got that. The

0:27:44.880,0:27:52.320
third thing would be a leather cape. Deer 
hide cape. We need five bones for that.

0:27:52.320,0:28:00.800
I don't think we have five bones. 
Do we? We ended up with no bones.

0:28:00.800,0:28:05.120
I thought for sure we'd picked up 
bones. Did we drop them somewhere?

0:28:05.120,0:28:09.760
Left them in Left them in one of the other houses.

0:28:12.640,0:28:20.480
We created a little storage over here. There we 
go. Well, we've only got two. Got plenty of meat,

0:28:20.480,0:28:30.960
though. The steer meat, uh, cooked deer meats 
a little better. Um, I think neck meat's the

0:28:30.960,0:28:43.360
worst. Lowest amount of protein. um followed 
by bore meat followed by deer meat. So for for

0:28:43.360,0:28:50.720
us the highest protein we can have right now is 
our deer meat. I'm not going to cook that right

0:28:50.720,0:29:00.720
now. We'll get back to that at some point in the 
near future. Let's put the um bones over here.

0:29:00.720,0:29:11.360
We need to collect a few more before we can 
make that deer hide cape. Three more bones.

0:29:11.360,0:29:17.600
That's going to use four of 
our remaining six deer hide.

0:29:17.600,0:29:25.600
Going to need another Let's do a place 
stacks. I want that deer hide in here. I'll

0:29:25.600,0:29:35.600
take those stones out. Um, but we're going 
to need some more storage. Let's stack two

0:29:35.600,0:29:46.960
uh two chests on top of each other. We'll just 
put a little shelf right here. Get it as low

0:29:46.960,0:29:55.920
as I can and just drop it right there. And 
build another chest for crafting materials.

0:29:59.680,0:30:05.680
There we go. No, that's actually food.

0:30:05.680,0:30:14.160
We'll organize this a little bit later. For 
now, let's go see if we can make our beehive.

0:30:14.160,0:30:21.520
Where do we want our bees? Let's just put them 
right here. We want them close to the house,

0:30:21.520,0:30:25.120
but we don't want to have to listen 
to that buzzing all the time.

0:30:27.760,0:30:32.320
I like to get them up off the ground. Um,

0:30:32.320,0:30:42.800
so I create a little uh pole there 
and then drop the beehive on top of it

0:30:42.800,0:30:46.000
and the bees are happy. You get

0:30:46.000,0:30:53.920
uh multiple beehives together and 
they end up being not so happy.

0:30:55.120,0:31:11.840
This is fine just for for aesthetics. I don't 
have enough wood anyway. Okay. So, we need more.

0:31:11.840,0:31:19.280
We need more bones for our deerhide armor. And we

0:31:19.280,0:31:22.880
need to explore some more. 
And we need more deerhide.

0:31:26.320,0:31:37.760
So, we're just going to spend some time exploring.

0:31:37.760,0:31:49.520
Oh, yeah. We've got another uh beehive over 
here. Where is it? I hear it, but I don't see it.

0:31:49.520,0:31:52.240
There it is. It's in that front corner.

0:32:00.880,0:32:11.760
I really like how serene the meadows is. 
It's so peaceful. Going to need uh wood for a

0:32:11.760,0:32:16.240
crafting table. A workbench. The crafting table

0:32:16.240,0:32:20.560
is called a workbench. Going 
to need some wood for that.

0:32:23.360,0:32:32.960
Let's just take this old 
stump and maybe that old log.

0:32:32.960,0:32:39.760
[Music]

0:32:39.760,0:32:47.280
Got to keep an eye on my stamina and not 
always drain it from running everywhere.

0:32:50.480,0:33:09.120
All right, get a crafting 
table. We can tear this down.

0:33:09.120,0:33:14.640
What's holding that up? There we go.

0:33:17.040,0:33:22.640
We can probably use this 
lumber. Let's tear it all down.

0:33:22.640,0:33:43.280
I like using the repair just so I don't have some 
image of what I'm trying to build showing up.

0:33:44.800,0:33:54.400
Now, if you're curious, uh, any of this falling 
lumber is not going to cause damage. So,

0:33:54.400,0:34:03.520
we can stand here in the middle while 
it falls apart. It won't hurt us.

0:34:08.960,0:34:17.600
Nice source of lumber and it's 
easier than chopping down trees.

0:34:17.600,0:34:23.680
Going to run back to base real quick.

0:34:23.680,0:34:30.800
So, now that we have a base, probably want 
to mark this on the map so that I can come

0:34:30.800,0:34:38.240
back to it. We may end up exploring and make 
a temporary bed somewhere. So, right now,

0:34:38.240,0:34:43.920
the only way we know where our base is is 
it's right here where this bed is. But if

0:34:43.920,0:34:55.760
we happen to make a temporary bed, we wouldn't 
know where this is to come back to it. I mean,

0:34:55.760,0:35:00.480
I don't know how good you are with maps 
and directions, but I get lost pretty easy.

0:35:01.440,0:35:10.080
So, I'm going to drop a house icon right here so 
we know that that's where our house is. We'll just

0:35:10.080,0:35:27.280
call that home. And let's come out here. We'll 
continue our beehives in this general area.

0:35:27.280,0:35:31.120
Hopefully that gives it enough room. we get 
them too close together, they're not going to

0:35:31.120,0:35:39.680
be happy and they won't make honey. But I think 
that distance will do it. I've never looked into

0:35:39.680,0:35:49.440
what the exact distance is. Sure, the internet 
could tell us. Those bees are happy. Those bees

0:35:49.440,0:36:01.040
are happy. Both beehives are empty. Uh, by the end 
of the day, we should have one honey from each.

0:36:01.040,0:36:09.360
All right, I'm going to push it a little bit, run 
till my stamina runs out, just because this area

0:36:09.360,0:36:16.240
is not real threatening. Uh, but that'll allow 
me to build up our skills. We haven't really

0:36:16.240,0:36:21.200
looked at skills much. We've talked about 
them a little bit, but if we come up here,

0:36:21.200,0:36:29.120
we can see what our current skills are. And as 
we use each of these skills, they improve. You

0:36:29.120,0:36:35.440
can see we've mostly been chopping wood. And 
so, we've got a 20 wood cutting skill. As that

0:36:35.440,0:36:43.440
skill increases, it gets easier to cut down trees, 
takes less stamina, we get more efficient at it.

0:36:44.000,0:36:57.040
Um, I didn't mean to close that. Um, won't 
have a sword for a while. Our club skill is

0:36:57.040,0:37:05.360
a six. That's not great. Uh, club skill is 
one of the ones that we want to have. Um,

0:37:05.360,0:37:13.600
along with our axe skill. Our axe skills up to 
15. That only happens from fighting with the

0:37:13.600,0:37:19.760
axe. If we're chopping down trees, that's going 
to be the wood cutting skill, crafting skills in

0:37:19.760,0:37:32.400
eight. So again, as these skills improve, you 
get more efficient at it. uses less stamina.

0:37:32.400,0:37:36.080
But the

0:37:36.080,0:37:42.080
and there while there are ways to grind 
those skills out and improve them,

0:37:42.080,0:37:46.000
like we could go swing at 
that oak tree all day long,

0:37:46.000,0:37:53.040
that would definitely improve our wood 
chopping skill. Um, it's just not worth it.

0:37:53.040,0:38:02.640
Valheim is really more about improving 
your gear than it is about improving

0:38:02.640,0:38:08.320
just your skill.

0:38:08.320,0:38:14.240
So, we don't have um

0:38:14.240,0:38:19.440
big goal here. We're just looking 
around to see if we can see there's

0:38:19.440,0:38:29.840
a deer. We know there's deer in 
the area when we hear that noise.

0:38:29.840,0:38:36.400
Want to be sure and eat.

0:38:36.400,0:38:42.320
Get that stamina up. See if 
we can find that deer. So,

0:38:42.320,0:38:50.000
I'm hitting control to initiate the sneak. 
And we go into that kind of crouching move.

0:38:51.600,0:38:58.640
And sometimes we can sneak up on the deer 
that way if you can find them. I have a hard

0:38:58.640,0:39:13.680
time with all this scrub brush. I have a hard 
time seeing him. He's closer. I can hear him.

0:39:13.680,0:39:22.720
Keep an eye on that stamina. Don't let it drain 
completely out because then we quit sneaking

0:39:22.720,0:39:34.640
that gring comes up and he's going to force 
us to fight. I don't know where that deer is.

0:39:34.640,0:39:39.840
Sounds further away now.

0:39:39.840,0:39:44.800
There's a boar. Or is that just a tree stump?

0:39:58.560,0:40:05.600
We're going to need mushrooms. Um, mushrooms 
are used in different foods and as the game

0:40:05.600,0:40:12.560
progresses, we'll have different food recipes 
where we combine foods uh to make different

0:40:12.560,0:40:32.640
dishes. Mushrooms are one of the things 
that we'll cook with for quite some time.

0:40:32.640,0:40:38.000
Oh, I keep hearing the deer. I just can't see him.

0:40:40.720,0:40:45.280
I'm probably looking right past it 
and you're probably there going,

0:40:45.280,0:41:03.520
"Oh, it's right over there. It's 
over there, but I don't see him.

0:41:15.600,0:41:27.280
A little more treasure. Another torch

0:41:27.280,0:41:32.640
for me leather scraps. That's something we're

0:41:32.640,0:41:39.440
going to continue using all 
the way into the late game.

0:41:39.440,0:41:49.520
So, it's pretty good idea to take them out 
whenever you see one. [Music] All right,

0:41:49.520,0:41:55.440
there's one of our deer. There's another one.

0:41:55.440,0:42:08.480
Little harder shot when he's straight on. 
Got him. And here we improved our bow skill.

0:42:08.480,0:42:16.160
Too low. And we excited that boar. Come on. Ah,

0:42:16.160,0:42:24.320
I can't get there. Too far 
away. Let's take this boar out.

0:42:24.320,0:42:29.040
Come here, guy.

0:42:31.840,0:42:38.720
Cut some more bore or something. I saw movement 
over there. Switch back to the bow and let's

0:42:38.720,0:42:45.200
see if we can get a little closer to this 
guy without scaring him off. Shadows are

0:42:45.200,0:42:51.920
starting to get long. After this, we're going 
to run back to our house. We'll cook some of

0:42:51.920,0:43:02.800
that. Something's blocking our shot. Uhoh. 
Oh, he's gone. All right, good enough. Oh,

0:43:02.800,0:43:22.240
we got a trophy. We're going to need 
a few of those when we go to summon.

0:43:22.240,0:43:26.480
Should be getting this shield 
out and demonstrating though.

0:43:27.520,0:43:36.960
the parry technique. I don't 
think we looked inside this house

0:43:36.960,0:43:43.840
and doesn't look like there was any reason to.

0:43:43.840,0:43:51.360
Got another big clearing here. One more 
house over there. We're kind of pushing it,

0:43:51.360,0:44:11.680
but let's see what that house 
looks like. Another big oak tree.

0:44:11.680,0:44:16.320
Oh, we got a beehive in here.

0:44:16.320,0:44:23.840
So, that'll be nice. Let's go ahead and 
tear this down. Let's get that beehive.

0:44:24.480,0:44:32.240
That's going to take us into night, I'll 
bet you. Let's see. Look at the sun. Yeah,

0:44:32.240,0:44:41.040
it's almost evening. I'll 
tell you what. Let's mark this

0:44:41.040,0:44:52.720
and we'll come back here and 
grab that bee in the morning

0:44:52.720,0:45:00.400
and we can continue our exploration from 
there. Let's see. The house is this way.

0:45:00.400,0:45:10.160
See if we can get back before nightfall. 
Should be able to. We didn't really

0:45:10.160,0:45:21.360
push it that hard to get here.

0:45:21.360,0:45:27.680
Where was that deer?

0:45:32.800,0:45:37.200
Oh, nice mushroom patch.

0:45:37.200,0:45:43.440
We should put this on the map so we can come back 
here. It's not that far from the base. We're going

0:45:43.440,0:45:50.320
to need mushrooms. We've got raspberries 
here. This is a good place to come back to.

0:45:51.840,0:45:56.320
Let's just put a MR

0:45:56.320,0:46:14.880
RB mushroom and raspberries and 
let's keep heading for home.

0:46:14.880,0:46:26.160
3 seconds on our rested buff and we don't 
feel rested anymore. I hate using up. Oh,

0:46:26.160,0:46:47.520
that was a lucky find.

0:46:51.360,0:46:55.040
I think our clearing's just over 
this hill. Our house is pretty close

0:46:55.040,0:47:10.320
to here. Let's check the map. Where 
are we? We got a little ways to go.

0:47:10.320,0:47:18.960
Almost beat him to death with our 
fist. Uh, he's too fast for us and

0:47:18.960,0:47:34.400
we're out of stamina. Oh, nice 
of him to turn around for us.

0:47:34.400,0:47:42.640
Let's see if we can get back in the clearing. 
Should be able to see the house any time now.

0:47:42.640,0:48:00.160
There's our big oak tree. Hey, there's our house. 
No, that's just a tree. It's over there somewhere.

0:48:00.160,0:48:06.000
All right, we're going to uh get 
to the house. It's night time.

0:48:07.680,0:48:18.320
We'll go ahead and um wrap this video up here 
and then we'll continue this in the morning.

0:48:18.320,0:48:25.520
Thank you all for watching. I'm Grandpa Bud. 
We're playing Valheim. Glad you could join us.
