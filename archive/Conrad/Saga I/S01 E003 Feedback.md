### 🏹 STATE 2: METADATA DRAFT
**Hook:**
Day three brings the gift of the hunt. It is time to trade the flint axe for a bow.

**The Legend:**
Conrad stands at the edge of a new chapter in the Meadows. To face the Great Stag Eikthyr, one must first dress for the occasion, and that means hunting the swift deer of the plains. With a new Crude Bow in hand and a quiver full of wood arrows, the exile sets his sights on the horizon. There are whispers of a Black Forest nearby, a place where a true home might finally be built.

**The Chronicle:**
In this episode, I walk through the essential steps of early survival. I demonstrate how to use the game's physics to efficiently dismantle old ruins for wood and craft my first bow. We explore the thinning coastline, gather vital mushrooms for health, and stumble upon a massive abandoned village. Every step brings us closer to the dark woods and the first great test of the Saga.
