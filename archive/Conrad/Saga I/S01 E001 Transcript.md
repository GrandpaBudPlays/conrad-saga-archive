## 📜 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
They sent Conrad to the 10th World with nothing but the rags on his back and the call of the ravens in his ears. His quest is simple: slay the Forsaken or be forever exiled from the halls of Valhalla. He’s an old man in a young man's game, but he’s got the patience of the forest and the iron will of the North.
Today, the trial begins in the Meadows. We build, we hunt, and we take our first steps toward proving to Odin that Conrad is worthy of the high seat.

## ✨ SURVIVAL WISDOM & HIGHLIGHT GOLD

* **[02:43] - Survival Wisdom:** Explaining the 30-minute world cycle—20 minutes of light and 10 of dark—and the necessity of being indoors before the "bad things" come out.
* **[09:28] - Survival Wisdom:** The Weaver’s Diet: Understanding the fork system (Yellow for stamina, Red for health, White for balance) to manage survivability.
* **[14:41] - Elder's Wisdom:** Using the weight of falling beach trees to "cheat" the Norns and break birch logs for fine wood before having a bronze axe.
* **[22:11] - Survival Wisdom:** A warning for the Heirs: Always listen for the "hum" of bees in abandoned Meadow structures to avoid a quick trip to the stones.
* **[28:45] - Hearthside Reflection:** Explaining the vital nature of the Rested Buff for stamina regen and skill gain; a true Viking never works without the comfort of a fire and roof.
* **[00:49] - Character Moment:** Conrad’s "Leonard Skynyrd" red-headed look—the start of the legend.
* **[27:51] - Action/Drama:** The frantic race against the setting sun to slap a roof over the bed while the forest begins to wake.

## 📝 PRODUCTION NOTES

* **Abridged Potential:** **High.** This episode captures the essential "First Steps" arc, moving from a naked exile to a sheltered warrior with a claimed spawn point.
* **Thumbnail/Hook Idea:** "An Old Man in a Young Man's Game" — featuring Conrad with his first stone axe at the Eikthyr Altar.
* **Lore Integration:** Documents the discovery of the first trial set by the Allfather and the establishment of the first temporary sanctuary.

## 🎙️ COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH

* **Pacing & Flow:** * There is a significant lull in commentary during the character and world creation screens (0:00 - 3:16). While technical explanations of "seeds" are helpful, this is an opportunity to lean into the **Grandpa Bud** persona earlier to hook the audience.
* The transition into the first night (22:35) feels a bit rushed. Future episodes could benefit from "winding down" the day with more reflective storytelling as the sun sets.


* **Vocal Clarity & Presence:** * The commentary acknowledges fighting a cold, which impacts vocal energy and tone. While the "vintage" gear adds a certain charm, ensuring consistent projection even during illness will help maintain the "Seasoned Viking" presence.
* **Audience Engagement:** * The episode starts with a self-deprecating comment about "nobody watching". Instead, treat every recording as if the Mead Hall is already full; speak directly to the "Heirs" or "Exiles" to build community from the first second.
* **Filler Words & Habits:** * The transcript shows a frequent reliance on "uh" and "um" during technical explanations, such as describing world seeds (1:52) or food types (9:28). Practicing these "Elder Wisdom" segments as scripted or semi-scripted lore moments would improve flow.
* **Brand Alignment:** * There are moments of high immersion, but also times where the commentary shifts into "gamer speak" (e.g., "stamina bar of only 50 points" at 9:00). To strengthen the brand, translate these mechanics into survivalist terms, such as "an old man's weary lungs" or "the weight of the years".

### **Example: The Warden’s Sunset**

*(The sun begins to dip behind the Western trees, casting long, amber shadows across the Meadows. Conrad stops swinging his axe and looks toward the horizon.)*

"Well now, look at that. The Allfather is pulling the curtain on this day, and the air’s getting a bite to it. You hear that change in the wind? That’s the forest waking up, and believe me, the things that walk these woods at night aren't looking to share a cup of mead.

Time to stop our wandering. We’ve got enough wood for the night, and I can see the glow of the campfire waiting for us. There’s a specific kind of peace that comes when you step under a roof you built with your own two hands while the Greylings are out there grumbling in the dark.

Let's get these boots off by the fire. We’ll let the Norns spin their threads while we sleep, and if Odin wills it, we’ll see the sun rise on a fresh set of trials tomorrow. Rest up, Exiles. A tired warrior is a dead warrior in the 10th World."


### **How this follows the Brand Guidelines:**

* **The Practical Survivalist:** It emphasizes the game mechanic of the day/night cycle and the danger of being caught outside.
* **Elder’s Wisdom:** It frames the "Rested Buff" and safety not just as a mechanic, but as a necessary tradition for survival.
* **Cozy & Reflective Tone:** It shifts the energy from the "Action/Drama" of building to a "Hearthside Reflection".
* **Lore Integration:** It mentions the Allfather and the Norns to keep the audience immersed in the Othala-Garth.

## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:02.400,0:00:06.800
Hey everybody. I'm sure there's 
so many of you watching right now

0:00:06.800,0:00:12.400
because nobody knows I'm doing this. 
But hey, thought we would go through

0:00:12.400,0:00:22.720
Valheim from beginning to end and see if 
we can create a new world, new character,

0:00:22.720,0:00:27.520
and just going to see how Valheim works. 
So, I'm going to skip through this,

0:00:27.520,0:00:40.720
but they've got some settings here we can uh pick. 
I don't have a whole lot of preferences. I can uh

0:00:40.720,0:00:49.760
I can live with that. Like 
the mustache manu. Yeah,

0:00:49.760,0:00:57.520
looks like Leonard Skard. Let's go with it. We'll

0:00:57.520,0:01:04.960
make him a real red head.

0:01:04.960,0:01:22.640
Good enough. Haven't even 
thought about Dane, but let's uh

0:01:22.640,0:01:30.080
let's just go with Conrad.

0:01:30.080,0:01:36.240
And we're going to start with Conrad. I have 
played a little bit in the past. I got too many

0:01:37.680,0:01:44.960
hours in this to even mention

0:01:44.960,0:01:52.880
and we'll go with Terra Conrad and just a random 
seed the seeds um what the world [music] generator

0:01:52.880,0:02:05.680
uses to create your world. You can find online uh 
seeds from different people who recommend them.

0:02:05.680,0:02:10.720
Um, some seeds will generate a world 
where stuff is close and easy to get to,

0:02:10.720,0:02:19.920
and others will be really spread out and hard 
to get to. So, this is going to take a little

0:02:19.920,0:02:29.680
bit to generate. And once that's done, we'll be 
dropped into well, you'll see, we'll be carried

0:02:29.680,0:02:36.960
into the world. and then we'll begin trying 
to survive in the world of Valheim. Today,

0:02:36.960,0:02:43.760
we're just going to go through this character 
creation and try to get as far as creating our

0:02:43.760,0:02:53.040
first shelter. That'd be roughly about a day each 
day in Valheim. This is around 30 minutes. Uh 20

0:02:53.040,0:03:00.320
minutes of daylight, 10 minutes of night. During 
the night, we definitely want to be indoors.

0:03:00.960,0:03:06.800
and away from all the bad things that come 
and try to kill us. [snorts] Some of the

0:03:06.800,0:03:13.200
first things we're going to try to do is gather 
some rocks, some wood, make us a basic weapon,

0:03:13.200,0:03:21.520
um, and then a hammer so that we could build 
things. A hammer is the tool. I am not going to

0:03:21.520,0:03:31.760
read this to you. Uh, you can do that on your own. 
Basically, it starts the um world history of the

0:03:31.760,0:03:44.560
Valheim world. Valheim world has some really nice 
u Vikingbased uh mythology to it. Uh and uh the

0:03:44.560,0:03:50.880
the lore makes the game kind of interesting and 
discovering those things about Vikings that you

0:03:50.880,0:04:00.480
may not have known. or if you're a Viking expert, 
it's probably all going to be fairly familiar.

0:04:00.480,0:04:10.160
Here we go. This is a Valkyrie carrying us into 
the world of Valheim as a following soldier.

0:04:10.160,0:04:26.560
We are asked to defeat the foes 
that Odin has banished the forsaken.

0:04:26.560,0:04:33.360
So as soon as we touch down, I want to check the 
map and see what part of the world we discovered

0:04:33.360,0:04:42.400
on our flight in. Everywhere we go is going to be 
mapped and Uh there's different areas. We're going

0:04:42.400,0:04:52.720
to start out in the meadows, which is the safest, 
calmst area in Valheim, but even with that said,

0:04:52.720,0:05:04.080
it's pretty easy to die. Now, here we go. So, 
here's Hugenham. He will Hugan. He'll tell us

0:05:04.080,0:05:10.320
all about the Valheim world. Sometimes he 
talks too much and just gets in the way.

0:05:10.320,0:05:17.920
Other times it's really in useful information. 
Grabbed a rock so that we can create torch and

0:05:17.920,0:05:31.440
other such stuff and some wood. Um wants to 
talk to us again. Magic stones or something.

0:05:31.440,0:05:38.560
So, this these basically tell us where to 
find [music] the boss of the area at but

0:05:38.560,0:05:46.320
we've got a boss that is just right next to 
the starting area. We've also got some nice

0:05:46.320,0:05:52.560
uh water over here. Water's one of the first 
places we're going to want to go to. Got another

0:05:52.560,0:06:00.320
island over here. Uh and at some point in the 
future, we'll be able to sail to that island.

0:06:00.320,0:06:11.120
Want to pick up those sticks and rocks as 
we encounter them. They'll come in handy.

0:06:11.120,0:06:24.640
Let's try to make ourselves a club. We're 
going to need three more pieces of wood.

0:06:24.640,0:06:30.240
Just telling us that we have to craft 
items. have to forgive my voice today.

0:06:30.240,0:06:37.840
I'm fighting a cold for the last couple of 
weeks and it's still ah there's a boar. Uh

0:06:37.840,0:06:43.280
we'll want him later. I don't know if 
we want to try to take him right now,

0:06:43.280,0:06:53.200
but bores are great source of meat that you will 
use throughout the next three or four biomes

0:06:53.200,0:07:02.880
uh in different cooking recipes. Okay, we should 
have enough for a club now. Let's craft that club.

0:07:02.880,0:07:08.240
And now we've got a weapon where we 
can take that boar out. We could use

0:07:08.240,0:07:14.080
our torch. That's a really good 
weapon also. Uh especially for

0:07:14.080,0:07:24.080
grlings. And we'll see a gringling here 
soon. I'm sure grans are afraid of fire.

0:07:24.080,0:07:31.040
Yeah. Where did that board go? See 
our skills going up as we run around

0:07:31.040,0:07:40.080
and our stamina drains as we run. So, a 
lot of people say run everywhere. Other

0:07:40.080,0:07:47.280
people say don't run. [music] There's 
our board. Let's take this guy out.

0:07:47.280,0:07:55.680
Got a little improvement on our sword skill. 
Picked up some leather. No, just for me.

0:07:57.520,0:08:04.560
So, grains are one of the dangers within 
the meadow. Here's our leather scraps. We

0:08:04.560,0:08:10.720
can use leather scraps to create some 
uh leather armor for us. Right now,

0:08:10.720,0:08:18.560
we've got that rag tunic and we'll be able to 
make some trousers and a hood. And here's Hugen

0:08:18.560,0:08:26.480
and he wants to tell us about what we just did. 
All right. So, I think we're going to have to

0:08:26.480,0:08:36.960
cook that meat before we eat it. Uh, yeah, we 
can't eat. So, as far as food goes down here,

0:08:36.960,0:08:42.800
we've got these three different boxes that'll 
show what we've eaten. As we eat, it will improve

0:08:42.800,0:08:51.920
our health, vital to our survivability. in 
Valheim. We'll be able to find All right,

0:08:51.920,0:09:00.320
let's try the sneak. I don't think I'll be able 
to sneak up on this guy. Nope. I let my stamina

0:09:00.320,0:09:09.440
run out. And uh having a stamina barb of only 
50 points is not something I'm used to. Ah,

0:09:09.440,0:09:21.760
here we go. Got some food. Raspberries. Now, 
raspberries will provide us with 20 stamina

0:09:21.760,0:09:28.080
and seven health. So, [music] you also see this 
yellow fork. There's three different types of

0:09:28.080,0:09:34.960
food. There's a yellow fork, a white fork, and a 
red fork. Yellow forks [music] are stamina heavy,

0:09:34.960,0:09:41.440
so they'll give you more stamina than 
health. White forks are mixed. They're even,

0:09:41.440,0:09:46.960
gives you even health and [music] even stamina. 
And the red fork is health-based and will give

0:09:46.960,0:09:52.560
you more health. And we'll see those kind of foods 
throughout. Here's another one of the monsters of

0:09:52.560,0:10:02.240
the meadows. It's called a neck. Necks will drop 
some meat occasionally that we can cook over a

0:10:02.240,0:10:12.080
fire. And here's some flint. Clint's going to be 
vital to us upgrading from a typical like stone

0:10:12.080,0:10:21.920
axe, which is one of the first weapons we'll 
use. Once we have, we'll be able to then do a

0:10:21.920,0:10:31.360
flint axe. Flint axe is a nice improvement over 
the stone axe. So, now we can make a stone axe,

0:10:31.360,0:10:39.680
we can make a hammer, we can make a torch. I like 
to work on my axe skills from the beginning. So,

0:10:39.680,0:10:48.400
I'm going to go with the stone axe. And we'll 
just use that glove as a backup. Uh want to

0:10:48.400,0:10:59.760
keep gathering up flint. We probably need 30 flint 
that we'll use in the early parts of the game for

0:10:59.760,0:11:10.160
various crafting things. And you'll find flint 
[music] anywhere in the meadows along W's edge.

0:11:10.160,0:11:19.920
Each biome will have different materials that are 
useful. And there we go. Start working on those

0:11:19.920,0:11:26.800
axe skills. Axes are great for gathering wood. We 
can chop down these [music] trees. That takes a

0:11:26.800,0:11:34.560
long time. Not going to do that right now. There's 
our wood cutting skill going up. To start out

0:11:34.560,0:11:47.440
with, these little scrub trees provide a handful 
of wood and get us the basics of what we need. Uh,

0:11:47.440,0:11:53.520
bigger trees obviously are going to give us bigger 
wood. It's doesn't matter how big the tree is,

0:11:53.520,0:11:58.400
it's always going to be the same amount of wood. 
If you chop down a big tree, if you chop down a

0:11:58.400,0:12:03.760
scrub tree, scrub trees give different amount for 
big trees, but other than that, the size doesn't

0:12:03.760,0:12:15.680
matter. Okay, the trailings are going to come up. 
I feel like they are and they don't want us here,

0:12:15.680,0:12:34.880
so we have to defend. Let's try to Nope. 
Our sneak skills nowhere near high enough.

0:12:34.880,0:12:40.240
You'll almost always find a couple 
of berries right here at the start

0:12:40.240,0:12:49.760
along [music] with one piece of wood, 
one stone usually right around here.

0:12:49.760,0:12:54.080
And then there's typically one 
of these big monomaliths will

0:12:54.080,0:13:02.000
have a mushroom behind it. I'm not finding it.

0:13:02.000,0:13:08.000
There we go. Mushrooms. Mushrooms 
are another source of food. Little

0:13:08.000,0:13:15.680
different than berries. Uh mushrooms are 
white, giving us 15 health and 15 stamina.

0:13:16.240,0:13:25.280
So now you see we have two different foods 
that we've consumed. This is going to last

0:13:25.280,0:13:29.600
another 7 minutes. This is going to last 
us [music] 15 minutes. And now our health

0:13:29.600,0:13:38.960
is oh god twice as high as it was to 
begin with. Somewhere in that order.

0:13:38.960,0:13:54.680
Okay. Here is the altar to eat. 
They're the boss of the first biome

0:13:54.680,0:14:00.960
[snorts]

0:14:00.960,0:14:09.200
tells us to hunt his kins. So, what we're going 
to need to do, we're going to hunt the deer,

0:14:09.200,0:14:18.320
get deer trophies, and eventually we can sacrifice 
some deer trophies at the altar. Summoning there,

0:14:18.320,0:14:24.880
which will beat the boss. So, here we see 
beach trees. These are birch trees. If

0:14:24.880,0:14:31.680
you see the beach tree and we hit it, you 
can see we did 7.3 damage. Hit the birch.

0:14:31.680,0:14:41.280
It is too hard. We aren't going to be 
able to chop down birch trees until we

0:14:41.280,0:14:51.360
have moved onto the black forest, discovered 
copper 10, made bronze, and created a bronze axe.

0:14:52.080,0:14:59.120
Now, if you get lucky, you can knock down 
one of these big trees into one of these

0:14:59.120,0:15:07.120
birch trees and it'll knock it over and then you 
can roll it the logs into each other until it

0:15:07.120,0:15:18.640
finally breaks and get fine wood. Done that 
in the past. It is a little time consuming.

0:15:18.640,0:15:31.840
And um I don't know if it's worth it. However, it 
does allow us to create a bow. Now, by the way,

0:15:31.840,0:15:37.440
I'm just pointing at these items on the 
ground and hitting the letter E to pick

0:15:37.440,0:15:47.440
them up. It's kind of self-explanatory. 
The game tells you that you need to hit E.

0:15:51.760,0:15:58.400
Yeah, once we create a fire, we can cook.

0:15:58.400,0:16:08.320
We get lucky. Oh, only got a small piece of it.

0:16:08.320,0:16:16.080
There's another boar. After we 
take care of this grimlin cring

0:16:16.080,0:16:22.400
typically will drop resin and resin 
is a nice crafting material. Uh you

0:16:22.400,0:16:31.440
probably use it for quite some 
time through multiple biomes.

0:16:31.440,0:16:46.880
Each boar typically drops one boar meat and 
one leather scrap unless we get a starred boar.

0:16:46.880,0:16:52.480
Starred bores come in the one star 
and two star variety. You'll see a

0:16:52.480,0:17:00.400
star next to the main bore. And then they 
drop I think it's two and four of each.

0:17:01.520,0:17:13.840
respectively. All right, we've got 27 wood now. 
Seven. We can make a hammer. The hammer allows

0:17:13.840,0:17:23.360
to create a crafting table. And then the crafting 
table. It also unlock [music] these new recipes.

0:17:23.360,0:17:25.920
Let's move that out here.

0:17:27.200,0:17:34.880
just try to find familiar places for all 
of our normal stuff. So, we activate this

0:17:34.880,0:17:41.200
by hitting the number eight and we're using our 
hammer tool and right click and we can see all

0:17:41.200,0:17:47.840
the different things that we can do with the 
hammer. That's a cooking station, a workbench.

0:17:47.840,0:17:54.080
We haven't unlocked any of the building materials 
or the heavy building that won't come for quite a

0:17:54.080,0:18:05.200
while or the furniture. These recipes get unlocked 
as you discover the items needed for them.

0:18:07.680,0:18:15.040
So, the hammer is the first thing to

0:18:15.040,0:18:23.920
build to unlock your ability to craft 
uh lots of items. The uh Valheim,

0:18:23.920,0:18:31.680
I guess, is known as a survival crafting game. And

0:18:31.680,0:18:39.200
uh bones. Bones are really handy. They're 
in hard to find. Uh, we'll pick a couple

0:18:39.200,0:18:50.560
of these. Dandelions. I don't use them 
much. They do come in handy occasionally.

0:18:50.560,0:18:55.280
Right now, I'm just kind of exploring. We're 
trying to expand what we can see here on the

0:18:55.280,0:19:04.880
map. Um, see what's available. Uh 
we've been at this for a while and

0:19:04.880,0:19:12.720
uh it's going to be coming up 
on nighttime before too long

0:19:12.720,0:19:20.000
and we'll want to have some kind of 
shelter. Typically in the meadows

0:19:20.000,0:19:27.840
you can find abandoned buildings. And if we 
can find one of these abandoned buildings,

0:19:27.840,0:19:37.600
it will allow us to have shelter without 
taking a lot of time to build something.

0:19:37.600,0:19:46.240
Ah, here's an interesting thing that you 
find in these rock formations. They kind

0:19:46.240,0:19:52.400
of form the outline of what would be a 
large boat. And then at one end of them,

0:19:52.400,0:20:01.680
you'll typically find a buried treasure. Uh, we 
don't have anything to dig with yet, and we won't

0:20:01.680,0:20:16.320
be able to dig until we defeat the first boss, 
at which point we'll be able to build a pickaxe.

0:20:16.320,0:20:24.960
If we don't find an abandoned [music] building 
soon, we'll have to start building. Actually,

0:20:24.960,0:20:33.840
we see the sun's starting to set. We 
should probably look at building our first

0:20:33.840,0:20:44.240
shelter. And for that shelter, we're 
going to need a lot of wood. So fallen

0:20:44.240,0:20:51.440
logs don't drop as much wood. You 
got to keep an eye on that stamina,

0:20:51.440,0:21:09.200
not let it get drained completely like I'm doing 
because you're going to get jumped and that will

0:21:09.200,0:21:16.240
lead to death. When it gets to be 
night, we're going to see a lot

0:21:17.840,0:21:30.720
of these grings. A lot more of these 
grlings. Here we go. Another boar.

0:21:30.720,0:21:37.680
Going to head to the top of this hill. See what 
I can see from there. And then we're going to go

0:21:37.680,0:21:47.200
for a shelter. I am run sprinting by holding down 
shift. uh putting it away your weapon with R or

0:21:47.200,0:21:55.760
bringing it back with the R key. Uh that impacts 
how much stamina you use when you sprint. There's

0:21:55.760,0:22:04.240
another one of those rock formations that 
we talked about. Um but sprinting with your

0:22:04.240,0:22:12.880
weapon out definitely uses more stamina. 
So, okay, here's an abandoned structure.

0:22:12.880,0:22:19.840
Not quite big enough for much. Oh, listen to 
that sound. There's a beehive in here. If we

0:22:19.840,0:22:29.040
go in there, the bees are going to attack us and 
poison us, which at this point could kill us. Um,

0:22:29.040,0:22:35.600
not going to be able to use that structure for 
today. Let's just go ahead and start building

0:22:35.600,0:22:42.160
a shelter. We'll be well into the night 
before it's done. Let's go to our hammer.

0:22:42.160,0:22:49.200
Let's right click, go miscellaneous, build a 
campfire. Having a campfire will help deter

0:22:49.200,0:22:57.040
enemy enemies from attacking us. Won't stop them, 
but it's better than nothing. The next thing we

0:22:57.040,0:23:04.400
want is a crafting station. Going to put that 
crafting station right here next to the campfire.

0:23:05.840,0:23:10.880
Uh, it has to be on level ground or close to

0:23:10.880,0:23:18.320
level ground and we unlock a 
bunch more recipes with that.

0:23:18.320,0:23:24.320
Then he wants to tell us that 
we built a workbench and that

0:23:24.320,0:23:32.160
we're getting new building pieces, which 
yeah, that's that's true. Thanks, Uan.

0:23:32.160,0:23:42.800
Uh, let's grab that for while we're 
here. We'll be using for a long time.

0:23:42.800,0:23:48.640
Didn't have my axe out. You 
notice in the hot bar up here,

0:23:48.640,0:23:58.000
the highlighted items shows what we 
have out. Lots of recipes unlocked.

0:23:58.000,0:24:04.640
Now he's telling us that it gets cold at night 
and it gets dangerous. Yeah, that's certainly

0:24:04.640,0:24:16.640
true. Okay, let's go back to our hammer. Let's 
start building ourselves a small structure

0:24:16.640,0:24:22.720
that uses two wood. That uses two wood. 
Not much difference. Let's then rather

0:24:22.720,0:24:33.920
than having two posts, let's just drop a 
wall here. We'll put a floor on that wall.

0:24:33.920,0:24:48.320
Trying to build a little platform 
that we can now add a bed to

0:24:48.320,0:24:52.080
and

0:24:52.080,0:24:55.920
little information about the bed we built.

0:24:59.360,0:25:07.200
Okay, we can't use that bed until it's 
enclosed. So, let's go back. Put some

0:25:07.200,0:25:18.320
walls around it. See how much wood we're going 
to have. How much more we're going to need.

0:25:18.320,0:25:40.320
Hitting E to switch our uh binding points or 
the points at which uh piece clicks into place.

0:25:40.320,0:25:47.280
Now put away the hammer for a minute. The bed's 
unclaimed. I'm going to hit E to claim it.

0:25:47.280,0:25:54.000
It's going to tell me it needs a roof. So, let's 
go ahead put a roof over it. We'll just use these

0:25:54.000,0:26:01.280
little 26 in pieces using the mouse wheel to 
rotate that into position. Now, we've got a

0:26:01.280,0:26:09.760
basic roof over it. The bed's too exposed. 
Typically, we can get one more wall up here.

0:26:09.760,0:26:16.320
And we need a little more wood for that wall. 
Wonder if a half wall does it. I bet it doesn't.

0:26:18.720,0:26:24.880
Yep. Still too exposed. So, I'm going to use 
the right uh mouse wheel click to destroy

0:26:24.880,0:26:37.520
that item. And let's go grab a little bit 
more wood. It's night time. This is really

0:26:37.520,0:26:44.640
uh where we get in trouble. Running 
around at night could lead to your death.

0:26:45.760,0:26:52.240
Let's see. We're getting our stamina drained. 
We're food's running, starting to run out. So,

0:26:52.240,0:26:59.120
as the timer runs down, it slowly 
decreases the benefit that it gives

0:26:59.120,0:27:08.400
you. So, if it starts out giving you 15 
health, when you get down to 2 minutes,

0:27:08.400,0:27:20.800
I must be hitting a rock and lot. Oh, I'm using 
club, which is not nearly as effective as the axe.

0:27:20.800,0:27:29.680
That should be just enough to finish this 
up. The idea is we'd like to get in bed,

0:27:29.680,0:27:40.720
sleep through the night so 
that we don't get attacked.

0:27:40.720,0:27:51.200
Switch to the hammer. Pick a wall. 
Going to turn that around just for fun.

0:27:51.200,0:27:54.960
Still too exposed. All right, let's try adding

0:27:54.960,0:28:08.320
u more roofing or close off that 
roof with this 26 in 26°ree piece.

0:28:08.320,0:28:14.720
Typically, that's enough spawn point set. 
So if we die, we come right back here.

0:28:14.720,0:28:22.480
The enemies are too close, but he's 
walking off. And now we're resting.

0:28:22.480,0:28:26.400
So we'll sleep through the night. 
We may or may not have a dream,

0:28:26.400,0:28:32.960
which will show up here on that black screen. And

0:28:32.960,0:28:45.520
we now have our rested buff. Rested buff is 
crucial. It affects how fast your stamina regens,

0:28:45.520,0:28:51.120
uh, how fast your health regens, how 
fast your skill points gain. You want

0:28:51.120,0:28:59.200
to always operate with your rested buff 
whenever possible. To get the rested buff,

0:28:59.200,0:29:08.080
you need a fire and a roof over your 
head. So, you'll see this sheltered icon.

0:29:10.480,0:29:13.200
There it is. Sheltered. Uh,

0:29:13.200,0:29:28.080
there must be another gring nearby or 
something. We're not getting sheltered.

0:29:28.080,0:29:33.840
There. We've got sheltered and we're 
resting. We've got a comfort level four.

0:29:33.840,0:29:37.920
As we move on through the game, we'll 
be able to increase our comfort level,

0:29:37.920,0:29:44.880
which will give us a longest time, a 
longer timer on our rested buff. All right,

0:29:44.880,0:29:50.800
we made it through one day in the 
world of Valheim. We didn't die. Uh,

0:29:50.800,0:29:57.120
we were able to discover a few things. There's 
a lot more to do and we will continue that next

0:29:57.120,0:30:17.680
time. Thank you for joining me. I'm Grandpa 
and this is Grandpa Plays. Have a great day.
