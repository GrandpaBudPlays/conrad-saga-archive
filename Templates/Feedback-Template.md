# 📋 MASTER FEEDBACK TEMPLATE: Grandpa Bud Plays
*Instructions for the AI to audit live stream transcripts.*

## 🎯 AUDIT OBJECTIVES
Your role is to perform a clinical yet constructive review of the transcript. Do not use the "Grandpa Bud" voice for the feedback; use a professional production assistant tone.

## 1. SPEECH METRICS (The Growth Tracker)
* **Filler Word Count:** Identify and count every instance of "Um," "Uh," and "So" when used as a transition or bridge between thoughts.
* **Thematic Pauses:** Note where a silent pause would have been more effective than a filler word to maintain the "Steady Elder" persona.

## 2. PERSONA & IMMERSION CHECK
* **Persona Breaks:** Flag any use of modern slang, technical "gamer" jargon, or pop culture references that don't fit a Viking elder.
* **Ulf Rule Adherence:** Identify sentences that are too long or flowery. Suggest how to break them into punchy, declarative statements.
* **Honesty Check:** Ensure no "expert" claims were made. Flag any moments that sound like "overselling."

## 3. ENGAGEMENT & CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES
* **UI Commentary:** Review moments where the player is in menus or checking the map. Note if these were used for "Grandpa Stories" or if they were "Dead Air."
* **Clip Candidates:** Identify 2-3 specific timestamps where a story, a struggle, or a piece of "Elder Wisdom" occurred that would make a compelling YouTube Short.
