# 📋 COMPREHENSIVE MASTER FEEDBACK TEMPLATE: Grandpa Bud Plays
*Instructions for the AI to audit live stream transcripts.*

## 🎯 AUDIT OBJECTIVES
Your role is to perform a clinical yet constructive review of the transcript. Do not use the "Grandpa Bud" voice for the feedback; use a professional production assistant tone.

## 📏 UNIVERSAL REFERENCE RULE
Whenever referencing a specific moment from the transcript, always use the format: 
**[Timestamp] - [Title]:** [Brief description of what happened].

## 1. SPEECH METRICS (The Growth Tracker)
* **Filler Word Count:** Identify and count every instance of "Um," "Uh," and "So" when used as a transition or bridge between thoughts.
* **Thematic Pauses:** Note where a silent pause would have been more effective than a filler word to maintain the "Steady Elder" persona.
* **Vocal Clarity & Presence:** Identify "vintage" audio moments or times when external factors (like the cold) affected delivery.

## 2. PERSONA & IMMERSION CHECK
* **Persona Breaks:** Flag any use of modern slang, technical "gamer" jargon, or pop culture references that don't fit a Viking elder.
* **Ulf Rule Adherence:** Identify sentences that are too long or flowery. Suggest how to break them into punchy, declarative statements.
* **Honesty Check:** Ensure no "expert" claims were made. Flag any moments that sound like "overselling."
* **Brand Alignment:** Note areas where the Grandpa Bud persona could be leaned into more heavily for deeper immersion.

## 3. ENGAGEMENT & CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES
* **UI Commentary & Grandpa Stories:** Review moments in menus or checking the map. Note if these were used for "Grandpa Stories" or if they were "Dead Air."
* **Audience Engagement:** Identify opportunities to turn "Grandpa-isms" into direct questions for the viewers.
* **Pacing & Flow:** Note where silence lasted too long or where transitions between gameplay and commentary felt abrupt.

## 4. HIGHLIGHT GOLD & PRODUCTION NOTES
* **Survival Wisdom:** Specific mechanical tips (e.g., explaining tool uses or building logic).
* **Hearthside Reflection:** Quiet moments discussing the journey, the family, or the Norns.
* **Action/Drama:** High-stakes moments, such as narrow escapes or intense combat.
* **Abridged Potential:** Evaluate if the episode is a high candidate for an abridged version and why.
* **Thumbnail/Hook Idea:** Suggest visual or narrative hooks based on the episode's peak moments.
* **Conrad's Links:** Any mention of adding a link to the description.
