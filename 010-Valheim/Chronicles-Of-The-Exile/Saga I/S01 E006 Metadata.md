## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The trial is long, but Conrad’s patience is longer. In this chronicle, the exile pushes the very boundaries of the land—taming the wild boars of the Meadows and braving the dark burial chambers of the Black Forest.

From the slow, steady work of animal husbandry to the adrenaline-fueled terror of outrunning a Troll in the dark, an old man knows that survival is a game of endurance. Valhalla is watching, and every Surtling Core found is a step closer to the forge.

Conrad’s trip into the Black Forest was a gamble that paid off in bone and fire. While an old warrior doesn't always show his excitement on the outside, finding enough Surtling Cores to build the kiln is a victory that echoes all the way to Valhalla. The pulse stays steady and the heart is ready for the work ahead.
