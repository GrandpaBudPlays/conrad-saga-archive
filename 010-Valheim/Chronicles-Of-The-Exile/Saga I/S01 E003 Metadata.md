## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The Meadows are no longer a prison; they are a workshop. From Day 3 to Day 5, Conrad begins to impose his will on the 10th World. Between the construction of a permanent hall and the first chilling sight of a Troll on the horizon, the path to Valhalla is being built one stone at a time.
In this chronicle, we master the physics of the North, claim the sweetness of the bees, and find the dark edge where the Meadows meet the Black Forest. An old man knows that a strong roof is just as important as a sharp axe. The Allfather is watching the foundation we lay.

Odin smiled upon me and I am starting to get the audio mix in the right place but he's cursed me with this cold ( sorry about the sniffles  ).

A mystery of the Meadows: I mention reaching Comfort Level 4. Sitting by a fire is 1; adding a roof and a bed gets us to 4. If you know where Comfort Level 2 went, or if you have a link to the Valheim Building Guide I mentioned, please leave a word in the comments. Even an old geek is always learning.

If you want to play along on this same map, the seed is L4y2XbwA0V. Let me know how your progress compares to Conrad's!

Note: Last three characters of the seed are A, zero, V.
