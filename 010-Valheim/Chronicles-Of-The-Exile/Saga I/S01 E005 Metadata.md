## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
Before a warrior can master the land, he must understand the forces that govern it. Conrad begins this chronicle by peering into the very fabric of the world—the modifiers and laws that dictate his exile.

Once the study is done, we return to the dirt. Day 8 is a journey of expansion: securing more golden honey, facing the sting of the wild, and treading carefully into the smallest shadows of the Black Forest. An old man knows that knowledge is a sharper tool than any flint axe. Valhalla favors the wise.
