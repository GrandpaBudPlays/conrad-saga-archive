## 💬 THE TRANSCRIPT
> **Note:** This is raw dialogue. The Norns have woven these words as they fell.

0:00:10.560,0:00:14.720
Welcome, exiles. The beat is cold,

0:00:14.720,0:00:24.800
the hearth is warm. The saga continues.
I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.

0:00:24.800,0:00:29.680
The peaks are calling. We 
left the king's ransom in

0:00:29.680,0:00:37.200
frozen tears back in the high snows
of episode 43. My back may be old,

0:00:37.200,0:00:48.720
but the forge is hungry. Today, we trudge
back into the cold to bring back that ore.

0:00:48.720,0:00:54.880
And with that, let's look to get things started.

0:01:01.440,0:01:05.760
Nice storm we're having.

0:01:05.760,0:01:11.600
Really, really like these

0:01:11.600,0:01:23.840
early axes. They are a lot of fun. Now,
problem is is if we're heading into the

0:01:23.840,0:01:39.760
mountains, they're probably not 
going to be our tool of choice,

0:01:39.760,0:01:45.280
but they are fun. I look forward 
to the next playthrough I have.

0:01:46.400,0:02:00.720
Uh, and getting these in the meadows.

0:02:00.720,0:02:16.720
make a huge difference to your meta's game.

0:02:16.720,0:02:23.760
So, we're not going to need 
both of those portals. We've got

0:02:23.760,0:02:29.600
uh we've got two portals in place already. So,

0:02:32.560,0:02:42.480
Yeah, we used that space up. I 
guess we'll have to go next door.

0:02:42.480,0:02:46.720
There we go.

0:02:46.720,0:02:52.320
Wow, that is some storm we're having.

0:02:52.320,0:02:56.560
Let's see if that'll get us there.

0:03:17.840,0:03:23.040
Well, we probably are going to need to

0:03:32.640,0:03:39.200
to grab some of these uh frost potions

0:03:39.200,0:03:44.320
and take them with us.

0:03:44.320,0:03:51.520
and going to switch uh

0:03:51.520,0:04:00.960
back to our heavy armor.

0:04:00.960,0:04:10.960
Make for a little bit slower growing, but 
it uh should dull the bite of those wolves.

0:04:20.000,0:04:27.920
Quick repair on the armor.

0:04:27.920,0:04:34.240
And uh got to Oh, that was not what 
I intended. Got to remember exactly

0:04:34.240,0:04:40.320
where we left off because it's been a while 
since I was up here. If I remember right,

0:04:40.320,0:04:52.560
we were preparing a cart and now we're 
freezing. Drink that frost potion.

0:04:52.560,0:05:05.040
We were preparing a cart to 
haul this back down the hill.

0:05:05.040,0:05:19.840
So, I wonder where we left the cart. 
Or do we just want to get a new one?

0:05:19.840,0:05:28.240
That fire keeps us from freezing. We'll still 
be cold, but it takes away the freeze effect

0:05:28.240,0:05:32.240
uh while we're next to it.

0:05:34.240,0:05:46.800
So, for the cart, we're going to need 
10 bronze nails and 20 wood. Well,

0:05:46.800,0:05:55.840
we've got 20 bronze nails. So, we can take 
half of those. We're carrying 28 wood,

0:05:55.840,0:06:04.720
so I'd like to pick up a little bit of extra. 
I know we've got it. That stupid spice rack

0:06:04.720,0:06:16.000
gets in the way. I think we're going to 
have to redecorate pretty soon. The uh

0:06:16.000,0:06:23.520
accommodations here are starting 
to feel a little cramped.

0:06:23.520,0:06:27.600
Let's see what that'll do for us.

0:06:34.800,0:06:41.280
So, we're going to load the We're going 
to load the card up right here. Carry it

0:06:41.280,0:06:53.920
around here and out through there. Little 
tight in places. Let's see how it goes.

0:07:03.120,0:07:09.280
Well, I can hear those drakes. Probably 
won't be long before they're down here

0:07:09.280,0:07:22.000
on top of us. And we'd better 
make sure we keep our food up.

0:07:22.000,0:07:39.120
Don't need the rocks. Here

0:07:39.120,0:07:52.880
we go.

0:08:06.240,0:08:11.120
Get up that hill.

0:08:11.120,0:08:18.720
Okay, here comes the scary part.

0:08:18.720,0:08:21.920
We're going to shove down that

0:08:24.160,0:08:41.360
hillside and see how it does.

0:08:41.360,0:08:49.040
Well, that's definitely a quick 
way down. Let's follow it.

0:09:05.360,0:09:07.840
Now, uprighting that cart may be a challenge.

0:09:20.720,0:09:27.200
Let's see if we get up here above it. Can we

0:09:27.200,0:09:32.960
almost push it over?

0:09:41.680,0:09:48.960
There we go. Keep going. Keep going.

0:09:48.960,0:09:52.720
There it is.

0:09:52.720,0:09:58.320
Going the wrong way now.

0:10:03.600,0:10:08.960
So, now we're over here.

0:10:08.960,0:10:21.520
Come on up here and say that to my face.

0:10:21.520,0:10:34.560
Trying to reorient myself to where 
everything is. So, our tower is over there.

0:10:34.560,0:10:42.800
What does he think he's doing?

0:10:42.800,0:10:47.520
Let's see. We'll have a hard time getting up that.

0:10:47.520,0:10:54.880
I think we need to head this 
way. Oh my gosh, you guys are

0:11:03.840,0:11:11.440
Just going to be a pain in my

0:11:11.440,0:11:18.560
We need to get to that tower. And we're 
facing Are we facing the right way? No,

0:11:18.560,0:11:27.680
we're facing the wrong way. 
Might be hard to get up there.

0:11:27.680,0:11:38.720
Nope, that didn't work. Let's try it again. Nope.

0:11:38.720,0:11:46.160
Yeah, that's what I was afraid 
of. We can't get it up that hill.

0:12:37.200,0:12:45.600
No, you don't. Oh, no you 
don't. We just got up here.

0:12:45.600,0:12:59.040
That will be a problem. That thing 
continues to roll down on us.

0:12:59.040,0:13:05.120
Come on. We were up there a second ago. 
You can do it. I know you can. All right,

0:13:05.120,0:13:25.040
let's take a breather. Don't 
go backwards. Turn sideways.

0:14:28.960,0:14:45.040
Just while I'm thinking about 
it, it's a little early, but

0:14:45.040,0:15:07.200
All right.

0:15:07.200,0:15:21.360
Haven't

0:15:21.360,0:15:29.520
done a this a lot. Can you tell?

0:15:29.520,0:15:40.720
Oh, look how bad that's beat up. We should uh 
consider fixing that before we go on much further.

0:15:40.720,0:15:51.280
Well, we'll just repeat it here in 
a minute, but we're better off now.

0:15:51.280,0:16:00.160
Don't jump. Just go on over 
the top. Go on over the edge.

0:16:00.160,0:16:01.680
There we go. Come on.

0:16:04.480,0:16:26.560
You can run into that guy. I don't mind.

0:16:26.560,0:16:29.760
More than one way to fix this.

0:16:40.080,0:16:46.160
Get rid of that lip. Maybe 
it'll go over a little easier.

0:16:46.160,0:16:55.040
There we go. Hopefully it lands up right.

0:17:01.200,0:17:17.360
What happened? I guess we uh let our frost 
resistant potion run out. For shame. For shame.

0:17:20.800,0:17:33.280
We need to be sure and follow Astrid's rule. A 
full belly and keep an eye on your health. Okay.

0:17:33.280,0:17:45.840
A little of this, a little of that. That's 
uh 23. Let's go with the Let's go with that.

0:17:45.840,0:18:03.600
And I suppose we're going 
to be back in troll hide.

0:18:03.600,0:18:12.400
Let's be sure we're all repaired.

0:18:12.400,0:18:14.080
Okay.

0:18:20.080,0:18:25.520
Grab a frost potion

0:18:25.520,0:18:40.320
and uh see if we can't do better this time.

0:19:42.320,0:19:59.520
and there's our cart and 
it's completely upside down.

0:19:59.520,0:20:05.040
I don't think we're going to turn it over.

0:20:05.040,0:20:10.560
All right, let's uh

0:20:10.560,0:20:19.760
let's see. We don't need that and that and that.

0:20:19.760,0:20:25.680
Let's put that on. It's just slightly better.

0:20:25.680,0:20:47.440
Going to stick with the movement bonus 
for now. Think I like that better.

0:20:47.440,0:20:53.600
We just don't have enough spots. 
So, we'll have to come back.

0:21:00.640,0:21:09.760
Okay, let's mark this spot. All right, looks 
like we marked it pretty well already. No,

0:21:09.760,0:21:19.440
we want to know the exact spot. Let's 
put one of these guys right here.

0:21:48.320,0:22:04.000
Oh, you guys.

0:22:36.320,0:23:05.840
If I remember, we had some trolls living close 
by us. So, we'll have to be careful about

0:24:34.000,0:24:35.280
Yeah, we got some room to work

0:24:52.640,0:25:01.200
Yeah, it's kind of a toss up. Do we go uh up 
and come down or do we go start down and go up?

0:25:03.600,0:25:11.040
Thought this was a pretty easy route.

0:25:11.040,0:25:26.560
Are we freezing yet? No. We got 
three minutes to get out of here.

0:25:26.560,0:25:55.920
Wait

0:25:55.920,0:26:17.120
a minute. I'm counting.

0:26:17.120,0:26:22.640
That's up against the tree anyway. So,

0:26:39.920,0:26:46.320
I want to cut the tree down without 
tearing the card up. Not sure it's

0:26:46.320,0:26:55.120
going to happen. There we go. And 
it's upright there. It's perfect.

0:26:55.120,0:27:14.560
And I hear footsteps. Sounds 
like we've got a blue ghost.

0:27:44.160,0:27:54.400
Yeah. And we didn't even trip our

0:27:54.400,0:28:04.960
something. I'm thinking of our trinket power.

0:28:04.960,0:28:10.800
All right. Bunch of stuff we don't need in here.

0:28:23.360,0:28:38.240
now. This forest is going 
to be tough to get through.

0:29:33.920,0:29:38.240
Uh, see That's

0:29:38.240,0:29:58.800
kind of hard to avoid

0:30:40.560,0:30:47.360
I'm kind of stuck here.

0:30:47.360,0:31:00.400
We head down that cliff too far and we're 
not going to get back. to our tower.

0:31:00.400,0:31:10.000
Can't go up.

0:31:10.000,0:31:18.240
Can't see what I'm doing. 
Like a better camera angle.

0:31:26.720,0:31:31.760
There we go.

0:31:31.760,0:31:42.560
Excuse me.

0:33:46.400,0:34:03.520
There we go.

0:34:06.640,0:34:13.600
I fear getting too far down that hill

0:34:13.600,0:34:28.480
and then being stuck in the water.

0:34:28.480,0:34:31.920
Come on. Not this time.

0:34:34.720,0:34:54.640
Guess we're going to have to go around.

0:35:31.680,0:35:42.560
Oh, now we're hung up in the air.

0:35:42.560,0:36:08.480
You know, there's got to be a 
way down from here. That just

0:36:08.480,0:36:33.040
Where is our tower? It 
should be should be in sight.

0:36:33.040,0:36:50.880
Here

0:36:50.880,0:36:59.440
we go. We have arrived with the frozen tears.

0:37:04.720,0:37:13.840
Now we need to prepare a area to start.

0:37:13.840,0:37:28.320
Set up some kils.

0:37:43.120,0:37:48.640
Looks like we didn't bother to bring the

0:37:48.640,0:37:55.920
There we go. Circling cores with us.

0:38:07.520,0:38:17.600
Well, we should eat. Looks like 
uh sausage is on the menu today.

0:38:17.600,0:38:22.560
We need stone.

0:38:22.560,0:38:24.320
There we go.

0:40:14.000,0:40:22.800
Let's start with the uh raw 
ore that we want to get rid of.

0:40:28.000,0:40:47.600
Just that. And I thought we had some copper.

0:40:58.320,0:41:26.320
Then I think the next thing we want to do is bring 
down some of these pines. Set up a corewood fence.

0:42:58.000,0:43:09.120
Now that we're out of the mountains, 
we're not quite That's desperate.

0:43:09.120,0:43:18.320
Need to be able to drink 
that. We missed it anyway.

0:43:18.320,0:43:29.200
All right. So, we're going to need a 
crafting table. And then we'll start with

0:43:29.200,0:43:37.760
corewood beams. Let's start with a short one.

0:43:37.760,0:43:43.600
Then we're going to start

0:43:49.440,0:44:00.240
I think we'll start right here. We could probably 
skip the first post, which is what I was going to,

0:44:00.240,0:44:05.440
and just do something like this.

0:44:05.440,0:44:17.200
I want in that direction

0:44:17.200,0:44:25.120
and we don't need it, but just for aesthetics,

0:44:25.120,0:44:30.720
we'll put the post there.

0:45:03.600,0:45:13.440
want it to just poke through the top. There 
we go. So, we'll build a kind of a fence like

0:45:13.440,0:45:26.000
that out of corewood around our work area 
here. Try to keep out some of the roof raft.

0:45:38.480,0:45:48.800
want to be sure I'm not burning corewood. So,

0:45:48.800,0:45:54.000
that's good for now. Let's go get some sleep.

0:46:12.400,0:46:19.120
Little housekeeping real quick.

0:46:50.000,0:47:08.400
And now with us smelting ore, there's a 
good chance we're going to trigger a raid.

0:47:11.920,0:47:31.120
So, we really need to make sure we're on top 
of our food, keeping that fully replenished.

0:47:31.120,0:47:35.440
Keep both of these babies going.

0:48:29.040,0:48:33.840
Haven't

0:48:33.840,0:48:49.040
decided how we want to grow this 
space. Just keep it at the forge

0:48:49.040,0:49:02.320
or do we want to go beyond that?

0:49:32.000,0:49:42.000
kind of curious if and I don't 
know how I find out but is having

0:49:42.000,0:49:50.640
some of this anchored in stone make it any more

0:49:50.640,0:50:01.680
strengthened anymore. is 
the proper way to say that.

0:50:01.680,0:50:12.880
Ah, we need more trees.

0:50:12.880,0:50:20.080
We'll go through a lot of 
these pine trees for this.

0:50:24.720,0:50:25.520
As long as we're

0:51:30.560,0:51:48.400
There we go.

0:51:48.400,0:51:51.360
Here he comes.

0:52:16.080,0:52:19.920
Little early on the parry. There we go.

0:52:25.840,0:52:32.240
My parry timing got off there a little bit. I 
was throwing the block up too early. We were

0:52:32.240,0:52:45.040
just getting the block and not the full parry. And 
we got another copper deposit here if we need it.

0:52:45.040,0:52:48.160
Don't know if we're going to need 
any more of the forest marrow,

0:52:48.160,0:53:02.160
but if we do, we've got two close by.

0:53:02.160,0:53:08.320
What I do know we'll need is we'll need more iron.

0:53:08.320,0:53:13.200
That's bound to happen eventually.

0:53:13.200,0:53:16.640
All right, let's do this one. a little 
bit different. We're getting close to

0:53:16.640,0:53:29.760
the ground. So, let's go short here. And 
we'll put one on top and one underneath.

0:53:29.760,0:53:35.360
And then we can run that bottom rail

0:53:35.360,0:53:41.360
and extend the top one at a new elevation.

0:53:44.560,0:53:49.680
And now we need

0:53:49.680,0:53:56.320
I could grab that and bring it 
up here, but each one of these

0:53:56.320,0:54:05.040
is going to give us a little wider 
radius of a kind of no spawn zone.

0:54:07.680,0:54:18.480
Let's take this over here.

0:54:18.480,0:54:26.960
That should work for what we want to do.

0:54:26.960,0:54:33.120
Push that. Yeah, there we go. I like it when 
it comes through the top just a little bit.

0:54:35.360,0:54:55.760
I think we can take a right turn here.

0:55:20.080,0:55:24.080
Let's uh see if we can do a couple of these.

0:55:56.160,0:55:59.200
All right. Don't want that big fur tree. Oh,

0:55:59.200,0:56:11.600
we've uh let the progress slow 
down here. Let's get that going.

0:56:11.600,0:56:15.280
And let's see if we can't 
pick up a few recipes here

0:56:15.280,0:56:19.920
in a second after we get this next round started.

0:56:34.320,0:56:44.480
Now I think this is going to give us some 
new recipes. There we go. Wolf fired armor.

0:56:44.480,0:56:49.280
Froster. That's probably 
Oh, and the dar thing bow.

0:56:50.560,0:56:57.120
Boy, it's a toss up. Oh, the silver sword. I 
like the silver sword, too. But Frostner is

0:56:57.120,0:57:12.240
u Froster's the one that's going to 
be our first thing that we build.

0:57:15.440,0:57:21.600
though. I do want to try to 
build that iron sledge still.

0:57:21.600,0:57:32.800
All right. So, we're going to need 
30 silver. So, it'll be a minute.

0:57:32.800,0:57:40.560
Let's uh start moving some stuff around here

0:57:40.560,0:57:58.320
because we're going to quickly other room.

0:57:58.320,0:58:11.360
Thought we had some stones somewhere.

0:58:11.360,0:58:16.960
Put the coal out here. Grab us some more wood.

0:58:16.960,0:58:22.560
That's the wrong direction.

0:58:22.560,0:58:35.280
Keep that kil going so that we don't run 
out of charcoal. And let's keep that going.

0:58:35.280,0:58:40.160
Now, this isn't going to do us much good against

0:58:46.560,0:58:49.360
most of the things that are going to come at us

0:58:49.360,0:58:58.320
from a raid. But it's not a bad 
first line of defense and it uh

0:58:58.320,0:59:04.080
it at least gives us a

0:59:04.080,0:59:16.160
comfort zone. If we get a raid of 
drags, it's not going to help us.

0:59:32.240,0:59:40.960
Wow, look at that. And that and that.

0:59:52.720,1:00:08.720
No shortage on that part.

1:00:37.440,1:00:41.360
So it should at least just give us 
enough time to prepare for whatever

1:00:41.360,1:00:48.880
fight is coming. Unless it's drakes and 
then they're going to fly right over the

1:00:48.880,1:01:01.600
top of us. And I don't think we've seen 
any yet, but another rate could be bats

1:01:01.600,1:01:05.600
and they're kind of destructive.

1:01:30.080,1:01:34.000
This has a nice split rail fence look to it.

1:01:49.840,1:01:54.080
However, when the time comes, trolls just going to

1:01:54.080,1:02:02.080
simply walk around it and go in the 
water and come up on the ocean side.

1:02:04.000,1:02:09.520
Let's see. How far are we?

1:02:09.520,1:02:27.200
Let's do another section 
before we turn the corner.

1:02:44.880,1:02:53.520
Can't get it to pop up the 
way I want it to. There we go.

1:02:57.680,1:03:15.360
Now, as we go down, we need to cut more.

1:04:50.720,1:04:57.840
Let's see. How do we want this to work?

1:05:19.280,1:05:27.520
I do enjoy the feel and the 
vibe of a black forest retreat.

1:05:30.560,1:05:42.720
That sunset is gorgeous. And there the tree

1:05:42.720,1:05:55.840
just beautiful.

1:05:59.600,1:06:07.760
All right, we can get a couple more.

1:06:07.760,1:06:17.760
Think we're going to drop down here.

1:06:17.760,1:06:24.960
Not sure that's even touching. 
No, that's not in there.

1:06:36.960,1:06:52.400
So, we'll have to use the long one

1:06:52.400,1:06:54.160
about there, I suppose.

1:08:10.400,1:08:12.960
Let's call it a day. What do you say?

1:08:21.520,1:08:40.480
Looks like we got three more chunks to go.

1:08:40.480,1:08:58.560
Two more. Should

1:08:58.560,1:09:03.760
be one any minute now.

1:09:03.760,1:09:08.640
The nighttime guys are starting to show up.

1:09:11.360,1:09:23.680
All right, let's head. Uh, we've got 
some stuff on us that we can't teleport.

1:09:23.680,1:09:27.280
Like that.

1:09:27.280,1:09:33.040
We've only got 20. I thought we just picked up 10

1:09:33.040,1:09:35.920
in the morning.

1:10:10.560,1:10:14.400
Day 231

1:10:14.400,1:10:23.840
something. Oh, I think we're in the wrong 
place. Took the wrong portal. Where'd he go?

1:10:28.320,1:10:35.520
And we're cold.

1:10:35.520,1:10:44.240
How are we doing? Losing health. Haven't eaten.

1:10:44.240,1:10:49.040
Not very smart.

1:10:49.040,1:11:01.440
Astrid would not smile upon us this day.

1:11:01.440,1:11:14.720
So, let's try that again.

1:11:14.720,1:11:16.960
That looks better.

1:11:18.720,1:11:28.800
Once we get this fence 
built, I think we look into u

1:11:28.800,1:11:34.800
ah we can make the

1:11:34.800,1:11:35.300
hammer

1:11:46.720,1:12:02.800
Yeah, we don't need that yet.

1:12:38.160,1:12:49.280
Let's see. What all do we need to make Froster

1:12:49.280,1:12:56.400
silver shield? Wouldn't mind 
making the serpent scale shield.

1:12:59.120,1:13:05.200
But it doesn't have the uh

1:13:05.200,1:13:20.240
parry bonus.

1:13:20.240,1:13:30.480
Easy

1:13:30.480,1:13:39.760
to come by that. Okay, froster. 
We need five Ymer flesh and that

1:13:39.760,1:13:48.960
is back at the other place. So, we need 
five freeze glands and 10 ancient bark.

1:14:03.760,1:14:09.760
So, let's just grab a stack of ancient bark.

1:14:09.760,1:14:17.200
And I don't know that we even 
have that many freeze glands.

1:14:17.200,1:14:30.320
Ancient bark, freeze glands, yammer flesh. 
That's the hard one. Do we have five?

1:14:30.320,1:14:40.560
We have any. Where' that stuff 
go? No, we only got four.

1:14:40.560,1:14:44.880
Guess we should go see Howdor.

1:14:44.880,1:14:53.920
But let's drop this stuff off at the

1:14:53.920,1:15:02.080
We don't have a good name for this place. 
Going to have to give some thought on that.

1:15:02.080,1:15:09.920
Maybe we can come up with a good lore base name.

1:15:46.560,1:16:03.760
Just seeing what we have duplicated.

1:16:14.960,1:16:29.680
Take that outside.

1:17:12.720,1:17:18.480
There it is.

1:17:43.120,1:18:10.400
Nope. There we are. I want that. 
And let's just grab that 500

1:18:34.080,1:18:38.720
I'm curious. What is the thunderstorm?

1:18:40.160,1:18:45.200
The obliterator.

1:18:45.200,1:18:54.400
The obliterator is how you can 
get rid of items you don't want

1:18:54.400,1:19:03.520
and you can turn it into coal.

1:19:03.520,1:19:07.600
and I've never built it,

1:19:07.600,1:19:16.640
but let's see what it takes,

1:19:16.640,1:19:20.320
crafting,

1:19:20.320,1:19:27.760
eight iron, one thundersstone, 
four copper, and a forge. So,

1:19:27.760,1:19:32.160
we need eight iron and four 
copper. Go back to crafting.

1:19:38.080,1:19:44.560
Five, three,

1:19:44.560,1:20:00.960
four. We're probably going to end up 
wanting to get some of that copper.

1:20:04.000,1:20:08.640
Let's put it over here in the sun.

1:20:08.640,1:20:20.400
It's interesting uh looking contraption here.

1:20:20.400,1:20:26.080
There it is.

1:20:26.080,1:20:29.360
Wow. You can put a bunch of stuff in it.

1:20:49.200,1:20:53.280
just out of curiosity.

1:20:55.520,1:21:16.000
Oh, well heck.

1:21:16.000,1:21:19.840
Well, that's loud.

1:21:24.080,1:21:35.440
We got nothing out of it. Thor frowns on you.

1:21:35.440,1:21:39.040
Well, I don't know if I like that much. I don't

1:21:39.040,1:21:47.120
want Thor to frown upon me. That 
sounds like a really bad idea.

1:21:50.640,1:22:00.000
Let's grab the rest of the humor flashing.

1:22:00.000,1:22:04.480
We'll go back to making Froster.

1:22:04.480,1:22:12.160
It's on the bottom. There we go.

1:22:15.840,1:22:40.080
Well, I meant to get rid of it, but I 
didn't. And I'm not going back just for that.

1:22:40.080,1:22:50.400
I think it was 30. silver that 
we needed. And we needed some uh

1:22:50.400,1:22:57.520
the wood and something else.

1:22:57.520,1:23:02.160
Froster.

1:23:02.160,1:23:09.040
I wouldn't mind if they added a filter 
to this. Some way to sort through it.

1:23:16.240,1:23:23.920
No, that's a portal though, too.

1:23:23.920,1:23:32.080
Would be really nice.

1:23:32.080,1:23:36.560
Still can't make it.

1:23:36.560,1:23:47.040
What are we missing? Level 
three. We're at level two.

1:23:47.040,1:23:58.720
Well, we

1:23:58.720,1:24:07.040
going to stick this over here. So, we got a place 
to drop stuff like this when it's all too much.

1:24:17.600,1:24:24.880
Now we want to go crafting

1:24:24.880,1:24:34.800
anvils. We could do a uh we could do 
the grind stone. That one's pretty easy.

1:24:39.200,1:24:47.440
Just need a little more wood

1:24:47.440,1:25:03.520
and we should probably get that busy again.

1:25:03.520,1:25:19.040
Shut you up. Hate listening to 
that forge. There it is. Froster.

1:25:19.040,1:25:23.040
Now for upgrades

1:25:23.040,1:25:30.960
to Froster, we need another upgrade and 15 silver.

1:25:30.960,1:25:42.960
Okay. So, to get another upgrade, we could 
do an anvil, which is 20 iron and five wood.

1:25:42.960,1:25:53.040
Oh, and we're quickly running out of iron

1:25:53.040,1:26:00.480
and wood. Did we only grab enough 
wood for what we need at that time?

1:26:22.000,1:26:27.600
So, we just need the 15 silver now.

1:26:51.520,1:26:57.200
So, let's take a look at Froster 
here and see what we've got.

1:26:58.720,1:27:04.560
It's a little different weapon 
than what we've used in the past.

1:27:04.560,1:27:08.960
So, with our skill level, it's going to give us

1:27:08.960,1:27:19.840
18 to 29 blunt damage. It's going 
to give us 24 to 38 frost damage,

1:27:19.840,1:27:26.240
and it's going to give us 10 to 16 spirit damage.

1:27:27.040,1:27:39.840
compared to this which was just straight up 35 to 
55 damage. Froster is lower on the blunt damage,

1:27:39.840,1:27:50.000
but then it adds the frost damage 
on top of that. So would be at 30 42

1:27:50.000,1:27:54.720
42 to 67.

1:27:54.720,1:28:01.040
And then if we can add the spirit damage onto 
that, it's even more. The problem with split

1:28:01.040,1:28:11.280
damage is the resistances. U most of things in 
the mountains resistant to cold. So they may

1:28:11.280,1:28:22.240
be somewhat resistant to the frost damage. Uh 
not everything is vulnerable to spirit damage.

1:28:25.360,1:28:32.640
So, it's really hard to know how much damage 
you're going to get against a specific opponent

1:28:32.640,1:28:41.440
uh with a specific weapon. The really nice thing 
and the compelling reason to use Froster is the

1:28:41.440,1:28:48.640
slow uh when you hit something with the 
froster. One, it has the knock back. So,

1:28:48.640,1:28:55.520
if we look at that, we've got a 100 
knockback, and you'll see that when

1:28:55.520,1:29:04.480
you use it, it it knocks your enemies away. 
Uh, and then it slows them. And that is the

1:29:04.480,1:29:16.640
real real benefit of Frostner. And Frostner 
last through multiple uh biomes, not just in

1:29:19.920,1:29:27.840
Not just in the mountains. 
We'll be using it in the plains.

1:29:27.840,1:29:34.000
All right, let's see.

1:29:34.000,1:29:41.280
I'm pretty sure a

1:29:47.280,1:30:08.720
We're out of Corwood. Okay. Well, in the morning, 
let's load this guy up before we go to sleep.

1:30:08.720,1:30:10.160
10 more.

1:30:26.640,1:30:32.560
And in addition to its nice slow 
effect and cra for crowd control,

1:30:32.560,1:30:39.600
it's got that cool misty look to it 
where the mist rolls off the hammerhead.

1:30:45.840,1:30:52.960
So, if nothing else, I mean, that's that's 
the cat's meow right there. All right,

1:30:52.960,1:30:59.200
we need to find a storage location for our

1:30:59.200,1:31:06.800
weapons because we're running out of space again.

1:31:10.000,1:31:18.080
Guess we'll spill over in this direction.

1:31:18.080,1:31:36.000
But we do need to consolidate this down soon.

1:31:36.000,1:32:02.320
probably wrap this one up at 
the end of this Valheim day.

1:32:06.640,1:32:20.800
Right now, we're just trying to get as 
much of this silver smelted as we can.

1:32:20.800,1:32:27.600
And we're going to need to 
throw more wood on fire.

1:33:02.400,1:33:06.800
So, I think the next thing we'll 
do is start on our silver shield.

1:33:07.840,1:33:25.040
Let's see if we can't get this. Uh

1:33:25.040,1:33:34.800
can't get this rudimentary defense here

1:33:34.800,1:33:36.000
finished up.

1:33:44.720,1:34:01.600
See, we walked right underneath that. 
Going to have to add a bottom rail.

1:34:25.840,1:34:30.640
and we missed on that one. Didn't 
get it to poke through the top.

1:34:34.080,1:34:38.320
That's better.

1:34:38.320,1:34:46.320
So, we can walk underneath there.

1:34:46.320,1:34:51.040
Oh, let's go

1:34:51.040,1:35:06.720
right about there. Can we walk under here? Yeah. 
Yeah, we can. So, let's do there that, too.

1:35:06.720,1:35:23.360
And we need to cut this one.

1:35:30.240,1:35:48.560
This won't stop a troll, 
but it will slow him down.

1:35:48.560,1:35:52.160
And it makes it so we get less interruptions.

1:35:57.280,1:36:17.360
from the forest dwellers.

1:37:35.680,1:37:46.320
Let's give a froster a try. Well,

1:37:46.320,1:37:52.560
in that regard, it looks just like 
the mace. If they die right away,

1:37:52.560,1:38:00.240
you don't really uh know the difference, do you?

1:38:00.240,1:38:04.880
And we're going to get a storm.

1:38:04.880,1:38:07.920
Don't think we're going to 
need an upper one on that.

1:38:13.840,1:38:18.880
and don't think we can work out here because

1:38:18.880,1:38:30.960
we don't have a workbench. 
Let's go ahead and add one.

1:38:30.960,1:38:35.280
Want to extend this a little bit out.

1:38:43.760,1:38:47.520
into the water.

1:38:47.520,1:38:53.520
Probably not going to go too far with it.

1:38:53.520,1:39:02.000
And we need corewood.

1:39:02.000,1:39:11.760
I think that's our only fire. So, we're going 
to have to have a fireplace pretty soon.

1:39:11.760,1:39:21.200
For now, we'll just throw a roof over it.

1:39:21.200,1:39:29.360
Not the best look in the world, 
but keeps our fire going.

1:39:34.880,1:39:39.920
We've already run out of space in there,

1:39:39.920,1:39:41.840
so we may have to look at expanding

1:40:57.840,1:41:04.560
So, we're going to have to build ourselves 
a way out of there. Probably a gate.

1:41:12.720,1:41:21.120
And we haven't been eating. Shame on us.

1:41:21.120,1:41:28.560
Good thing a troll didn't come along.

1:42:24.320,1:42:49.680
All right, let's see if we can. 
That's not it. There we go.

1:43:24.960,1:43:40.800
Well, it's going to be hard to 
do that if we keep floating.

1:44:51.040,1:44:56.720
Let's see what's next on our agenda.

1:44:56.720,1:45:01.200
Draw a fang.

1:45:01.200,1:45:10.560
So, we get the pierce damage and we get an 
additional poison damage. It's not a lot,

1:45:10.560,1:45:15.280
but it is uh damage over time.

1:45:17.680,1:45:29.040
So the 17-31 versus our 15 to 27s, a nice little 
step up. And for the most part, the weapons are

1:45:29.040,1:45:40.320
never huge jump. Anyway, and now we need some 
of that guck that we collected in the swamp.

1:45:41.440,1:45:55.760
So, we need ancient bark, 
silver, deer hide, and gum.

1:45:55.760,1:46:05.200
All right, let's uh let's fill her up 
and call it a day. What do you say?

1:46:07.600,1:46:21.760
Make sure we leave everything behind 
here that we need to leave behind.

1:46:21.760,1:46:31.920
I hope that was regular wood and not 
core wood. Hate wasting core wood on

1:46:31.920,1:46:33.920
on something like that.

1:46:37.520,1:46:47.440
And we're going to be heading back 
into the mountains before too long.

1:46:47.440,1:47:03.280
But we've got a decent little forest retreat here.

1:47:13.600,1:47:25.920
and a nice tower from which to uh 
continue to build out our home.

1:47:25.920,1:47:32.560
So, that was one of the things I wanted to 
try to do real quick. I believe it's two iron

1:47:35.840,1:47:40.880
What else do we need?

1:47:40.880,1:47:52.080
We want uh not the forge, the stone 
cutter. Four stone and two wood.

1:47:52.080,1:48:00.400
I think we had uh well, there's three stone. 
There's four stone. Just need to grab the wood.

1:48:14.240,1:48:21.360
Let's put the stone cutter back here

1:48:21.360,1:48:38.240
out of the way. Easy to find. 
So now we can do uh repairs

1:48:38.240,1:48:54.000
to our tower.

1:49:15.120,1:49:20.320
Oh, glad the storm's over.

1:49:42.320,1:50:11.760
I'm curious as to if they had a reason for some 
of these What look like out of place stones?

1:50:48.400,1:51:02.720
Well, exiles, I think this is a 
close to the end for this episode.

1:51:02.720,1:51:13.440
have any thoughts on uh what we should 
do to expand our home here? I'd love

1:51:13.440,1:51:19.840
to hear from you. Drop me a note in the comments.

1:51:19.840,1:51:28.800
Yeah, it was um it was a really good day. 
We got Oh, can't do that yet. Let's go ahead

1:51:28.800,1:51:39.520
and put that stuff down. And we got some uh 
other stuff we don't want to take with us.

1:51:39.520,1:51:44.560
And we'll leave that behind.

1:51:44.560,1:51:50.400
Got a place for that over here.

1:51:50.400,1:51:57.120
Thought we had some more. Yeah. Leave that here.

1:51:57.120,1:52:00.240
And

1:52:00.240,1:52:10.400
we are out of food. Going to 
have to cook when we get home.

1:52:10.400,1:52:25.120
All that stone repair took a toll on our hammer.

1:52:28.000,1:52:43.680
We got a new weapon and we've got more silver 
ready to make the new bow. It's going to be um

1:52:43.680,1:52:53.280
it's going to be good. I think uh it's nice to be 
back in the mountains and working with the silver.

1:52:56.640,1:53:02.320
And with that, I suppose the meat is cold,

1:53:02.320,1:53:12.880
the hearth is warm, the saga continues. 
I'm Grandpa Bud. We're playing Valheim.

1:53:13.680,1:53:14.240
You all have a
