## 📜 PLAYLIST DESCRIPTION

Welcome to the Tenth World. I am Grandpa, and these are the chronicles of my exile. This chronicle holds the briefest threads of my journey, captured for those who wish to see the Norns’ trials in small moments.

In this series, you’ll find:
* **Survival Wisdom:** Quick lessons on parrying, building, and the Shieldmaiden’s Rule for resource management.
* **The Narrative:** Sudden encounters with Shadows in the Trees and the Strength of Stars across the biomes of Valheim.
* **The Lore:** My brief reflections on Othala, the Forsaken, and the Wyrd’s Weight that binds us all.

Grab a horn of mead, sit by the hearth, and join the journey. Subscribe to follow the saga as it unfolds.

The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.
Have a good one.
