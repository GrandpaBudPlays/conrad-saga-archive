## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION

I am. I woke. It was cold. 

Conrad learns the hard way that a roof is not enough to keep the cold out. Survival is not as simple as placing a few logs. Sometimes the world fights back when you are just trying to repair your tools. This is not a professional setup, but it is a true journey.
