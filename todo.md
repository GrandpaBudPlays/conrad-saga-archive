Is there a file/section that tells the AI what to do when it opens a repo
Where is the new World Seed Text
How do we make the mandatodry tags a strong suggestion and not mandatory 
Merge the "Narrative Description" sequence and the "Standard Link Repository" into your Templates/Metadata-Template.md.

Move the "Mandatory Tagging List" and "Hugin Perspective" into your new .gemini/styleguide.md.

Where is State 2 Narritive Logic Defined


1. Updating Your AI Knowledge
To ensure the AI knows exactly when and how to use these links, you should update your .gemini/styleguide.md (or your AI-Operations.md) with the following logic:

A. New Live Stream Draft Protocol
Trigger: When the user provides goals for a future stream (e.g., "Conrad is going to try to find iron"). AI Action:

Generate Title: Create a compelling, non-clickbait title.

Narrative Hook: Write 3-5 sentences in the Grandpa Bud voice (Ulf Rule) describing the intent.

Insert Links: Locate the Standard-Links.md file and insert the link block corresponding to the current Biome.

Format for OBS: Provide the output as a clean block ready for copy-pasting.
